        "(30 points). Sentiment analysis also known as opinion mining is a sub field within Natural Language Processing (NLP) that builds machine learning algorithms to classify a text according to the sentimental polarities of opinions it contains, e.g., positive, negative, neutral. The purpose of this question is to develop a machine learning classifier for sentiment analysis. Based on the dataset from assignment three, write a python program to implement a sentiment classifier and evaluate its performance. Notice: **80% data for training and 20% data for testing**.  \n",

            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Man.... I wish I loved this movie more than I did. Don't get me wrong, it's a solid action movie with jaw-dropping stunts (some of the best in the series), but as a Mission: Impossible movie, it felt like a small step backward for the franchise. Fallout had mind-blowing action sequences and stunt work, along with developing Ethan's relationship with Ilsa, providing closure with Julia, showing the lengths Ethan would go to protect those closest to him, and battling an imposing villain. Dead Reckoning: Part One stretches the movie across two films only to seemingly showcase action spectacle after action spectacle while sacrificing character development. Characters I have grown to love over a decade of films felt sidelined, ignored, or wasted. Hayley Atwell's new character chewed up most of the screen time, and while she was fantastic, I wanted to see more of the original team. The new villain had an inconsistent ability that confused more than intimidated. There were some important emotional moments that I just didn't feel the weight of when I definitely should have. Part Two might tie everything together and make me enjoy Part One more in retrospect, but unfortunately, I left wanting more from this one.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Just got out of seeing this movie. I am really disappointed that they totally killed off the potential relationship between Ethan and Ilsa. I am totally OK with her dying but the way that they did it and how anti-climactic it was after building up her character so much in the previous two films. Just seems like she would've deserved a better death than that. Also, what was the point of showing the two characters getting closer to each other, and in the last film, his ex-wife, basically giving them permission to move forward when you're just going to kill her off like that. Honestly, Rebecca Ferguson revised this franchise two movies ago and I think killing off her character was a big mistake. Even in the scenes that she's in it doesn't even seem like she's playing the same person. I wonder if they wrote her out of the movie because she's too busy with the rest of her work. Hayley Atwell's character doesn't make sense to me either. Just put her in the IMF because she can pick some pockets? This all seems forced. Maybe most won't agree, but I think this development totally ruined the movie for me.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Just saw this one in a theatre, and boy... what an adrenaline rush it is. The latest Mission Impossible features some of the most incredible stunts ever put to camera. The story is absolutely exhilarating and continues to bring new life to a veteran movie franchise. The sheer scale of this movie is epic, and with every twist and turn of the movie, you cannot help but marvel at the incredible sets used to bring this movie to life. Such a movie begs to be seen on the biggest screen possible where you can truly feel the grandeur of the film. Tom Cruise has once again delivered one of the best movies of the year, and I cannot recommend that you see it enough!\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: To me, a new M:I film is an event. From Part 4 onwards, they've been spectacular (all 10/10's).There's some good stuff here for sure, and overall it's a solid 8, but it's simply not as good as previous entries.I kept noticing that a lot of scenes had just 2 or 3 people in them, and I kept imagining the crew all masked up, as well as the cast when the camera wasn't on them. It can't be easy to make a huge movie like this during a pandemic, but it definitely shows.The A. I. plot is quite good, and Hunt's as-yet-unknown backstory quite intriguing, but the whole story basically revolves around: \"I've got the key, now she's got the key, now he's got the key\" etc. So much pick-pocketing.Also, I really wish they hadn't ruined the motorcycle jump in the promos. If you've seen the promo, you've seen the scene. There are really only 3 or 4 action sequences, and nothing we haven't really seen before. I actually enjoyed the first desert shoot-out the best.And- oh!- the exposition! There's a scene near the beginning that reminded me of a Neil Breen(!) movie, where powerful people sit in a room and just spout buzz words like \"nuclear war,\" \"economic collapse,\" \"dogs and cats living together\" etc.THAT said, it's still an 8/10. Tom always gives it his best, the rest of the cast is good (especially all four female leads) and I thought the added humour with Hunt's character was a nice touch. I'd rather watch this ten times over than any blatant cyncial Disney cash-grab.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Good God. I feel ashamed for approaching this film with a modicum of doubt that Tom would still be able to deliver. Unbelievably, this epic actually manages to top the brilliant Fallout. Tom is literally going to die if he keeps doing these stunts. The motorbike sequence is utterly ludicrous. Intriguing plot with actual stakes and some familiar faces ably supported by brilliant new allies and villains. Sets up Part II perfectly with a sensational finale that homages Back to the Future 3, MI:1 and Speed. It is funny, action packed, polished and exhilarating. Harrison was great last week, but Tom is still the King. 9/10.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: I was lucky to be able to watch this 4 days before its official release in Czech Republic as a pre-premiere (didn't know such a thing existed) and it was the first time I've felt real excitement to go watch a film at the cinema in ages thanks to the recent genius combination of Fallout and Top Gun 2.I know what they were trying to do with this film. Bringing Kittridge back and a convoluted train finale all harked back to the 1st movie that sparked it all off. Explaining that convoluted storyline along the way harks back to the criticisms made about that same first film.The sky jump stunt was an attempt to beat the stunts from Tom Cruise in previous installments that have now become a beloved trademark of the franchise.But this film unfortunately overall is most reminiscent of the second installment which was Tom Cruise centric and lacked any real impossible mission requiring teamwork, real stakes and ingenious problem solving.In fact, it could have even been intentional that this film reminds the viewer of Mission Impossible 2. The photos in the film of past Ethan Hunt when searching for present Ethan Hunt show him with his longer hair as he looked in that second film.Ultimately, I expected the story to be way better than what we get in this instalment.There are 2 guys that keep appearing at each scene trying to catch Ethan which seems a very cheap simple story.And the very simple plot is explained in long scenes to make it seem way more complicated that it actually is (people complained there should be more explanation in the first film, but at least the plot in the first film actually required brain power), and I have to say that some of the acting is quite poor at times, not helped by some rather cheesy lines in the script, including the lines and accents in the opening Russian submarine sequence.There is also not that much action. 3 main action sequences for a close to 3 hour movie, which are the desert shoot out at the beginning, the Venice car chase, and the train crash at the end.I thought the alleyway fight scene, which some have praised, was really quite subpar and not very enthralling.The best action scene is the Venice car chase because it is genuinely funny (yes, because it is excellently laugh out loud funny, but not in any way tense); I never had the feeling that I was on the edge of my seat.The motorcycle sky jump scene was a major disappointment after the hype because if you didn't know Cruise actually did do that stunt, they used so much CGI that people would just assume it was computer generated. It actually reminded me of Pierce Brosnan's riding the tsunami in Die Another Day (sorry Tom! The stunt is still awesome!).The same for the train at the end. I know they actually made that train, and probably actually threw it off a bridge, but it doesn't look real. Though it is a long action finale and very fun to watch, for me the lack of realism takes away any tension. You are enjoying it for its visual value, but again not feeling any 'wow' factor or tension.At the end of Fallout, for example, you really felt Ethan Hunt was battered, bruised, worn out and still fighting to save humanity. There is none of that.The most tragic thing about this movie is that, unlike in the best of the previous films, we're back to the team being irrelevant in this one. Benji and Luther don't actually do very much.And poor Ilsa. Fallout ended with Ethan's ex-wife essentially giving him permission to move on and be with Ilsa.The relationship between Ilsa and Hunt had been built up over two excellent movies - Rogue Nation and Fallout - and in this film she says almost nothing, looks grumpy and sad all the time, and dies in an anticlimactic fight that is literally spelt out to the audience as a way to replace her with newcomer Grace.Grace, played by Hayley Atwell, is good. A likeable character and a capable actress, but I don't get the story unless Rebecca Ferguson said she wants out the franchise.The film is all about chasing \"the key.\" No twists. No high stakes. There is virtually no grittiness in this outing. It feels very light.Ultimately I was hoping to enjoy a quality film in the franchise. A movie like Oblivion, Edge of Tomorrow, Fallout, Top Gun 2 or American Made that you can show to anyone and say these are recent really high quality films starring this guy called Tom Cruise.This is not one of those films.It is more like The Mummy. It is better than Mission Impossible 2 but not better than any of the others in the franchise.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One confirms that Mission Impossible is the best franchise currently going and possibly ever made. A 2 hour 43 minute adrenaline rush that contains some of the best action sequences put to film, embarrasses the majority of the competition out there and sets the stage for a magnificent part 2 whilst still being a satisfying adventure in its own right.This is possibly the most open and obvious a Mission film has been with its deeper meaning for cinema and what aspect of Cruise's career is being dissected this time with a film that focuses on Ethan's relationship with women and basically outright declares AI to be a soulless monster and how the human element is always needed (perfect film to release during a writer's strike).Tom Cruise is perfect as Ethan Hunt and the strongest aspect this time round is when the film explores what made Ethan who he is and reminds you he genuinely cares about his team but that comes at a cost. Physically, the madman is still going strong with his stunts, driving a bike off a cliff in truly breathtaking fashion.Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg and Rebecca Ferguson remain the best IMF team and all play to their strengths here. The longer this series goes on the more authentic their growing friendship feels. Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis get more than expected and their buddy cop antics are a lot of fun.With Esai Morales' charismatic yet terrifying Gabriel and Pom Klementieff's terrific henchman of few words, this franchise finally has more good villains than bad. The return of Henry Czerny as Kittridge is glorious and he remains as gleefully despicable as his first appearance.The best new addition is easily Hayley Atwell. She plays a type of character never seen before in these films which makes her character and dynamic with Cruise fresh in comparison to everyone who's come before and their chemistry is magnetic. Instantaneous from the second they interact.Christopher McQuarrie's direction is phenomenal. The action sequences are suitably practical (this is how you spend $290 million), and the camera gets as close to the action as humanly possible, he remains one of the best in the business working at this scale. There's plenty of canted angles as a nice homage to De Palma's original and it helps give this one its own style in comparison to McQuarrie's previous entries.The pacing is really impressive with the film feeling like it's in a perpetual third act from its first airport heist (which is so much fun). Lorne Balfe does the music once again and yet again it's a highlight of the film, he knows how to elevate everything so well and really hammers home the emotional beats.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Ethan Hunt has left the mere secret agent status and has ascended to the all living perfect messiah.There is so much wrong with this movie, which seriously pains me because I seriously love this series. The mission impossible movies have steadily become more convoluted and more stupidly written. This film reaches the peak of absurdity, feeling more like an over the top fast and furious movie. All foolish action, cheap parlor tricks to pull the heart strings (empty relationships), horrible writing, poor plot development.I mean seriously what ever happened to show don't tell?! This is becoming rather ridiculous.*convoluted villain dialogue*\n",
            "\"So what you're telling me is you plan to establish a new world order if you get that key and if someone stops you that would be bad?!\"Has Ethan Hunt suddenly become this vanilla James Bond? With the Bond girl cycling through every few films? Lazy writing. Not natural feeling. Forced. BlighIt pains me to give this so low.The truth is, this movie is mindless entertaining action. Tom Cruise delivers on some awesome stunts (seldom compared to other MI films). It's not horrible. It's fun entertainment, but a scour on the (in my opinion) reputable authentic feeling mission impossible series.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: So you probably watched IM 6 and said, they can't make it any better can they? Or Top Gun 2, guess again, this is an adrenaline action movie with a good story, well written, action scenes that just blow you away, not a boring moment and you are on the edge of your seat all the time, this is how you make movies! Tom Cruise did it again, WOW!! It's an exhausting ride he takes you on, man I forgot to eat my popcorn and by the time i finally wanted some my wife had eaten all of it, but hey I was so immersed into the movie that time stood still and i forgot everything around me.Go and see it, this one gets my full recommendation, the only reason it's not a 10 is due to the fact it's not a completely new type of movie, however this one is done as a good action movie should be made, i don't see how they could have made it better, I really can't, go watch it and have a good time while you do it, it will put a big smile on your face that's for sure.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Am huge fan of MI franchise. The best part about all MI movies were how they plan and pull off an impossible mission. Thus I am quite disappointed on how this mission never seemed too difficult , let alone impossible.Action was okay. Car chase was funny, but not exciting. Jumping off the cliff seemed forced to me. Why would you keep driving uphill when you can take short cuts to reach the train. It wasn't even a fast train. The key kept being stolen from pockets too many times which makes you wonder how lazy the scripting was. Kill old gf to make new gf was also lazy writing.Unlike other MIs, Ethan had no single smart move or plan. It felt more like let's go and see what happens.Am not sure how MI fans ignored all these weaknesses and gave this film 8+ rating.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: This was a great movie. However, it lost a star from me for making the audience believe Ilsa is dead. They've spent two films building up Ilsa as being Ethan's equal, and hinted at an eventual romance. She's been able to fight off multiple men bare-handed yet she meets her demise by one guy when she has a sword? Then they brush past her death like it means nothing, only for her to be replaced by a new woman. I thought it was a huge disservice to the character.I know Rebecca Ferguson is very busy so she might have asked to leave, but I'm hoping this isn't the end for my favorite character in these films. She deserves a happy ending, or at least a better death than the one she received in this movie. It really took me out of the rest of the film. Hopefully, we'll see her again in Part Two.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Remember that classic MI scene where they broke in at CIA, and Cruise was hanging from the ceiling using wires? It's not a huge setpiece, but that scene is a nailbiting example of ingenious problem solving.In 'Dead Reckoning' there's none of that. Here it's keys changing hands every 10 minutes that is suppose to pass as suspense. And of course the only true selling point: the stunts performed by Tom Cruise.But I want and expect more than that.A large part of the film is devoted to people sitting or standing in a room, explaining what the plot is. Endless talking and explaining. We are told in several scenes the same information we just heard. Worst one is Benji, who is merely there to repeat things for someone in the cast, to make sure everyone in the audience knows what is going on. That is sloppy writing. One of the biggest no-no's as a screenwriter is resolving to \"so what you are saying is, that...\" info sharing. Benji does this all the time. And he is as incompetent as usual. And he is supposed to be a part of a small and unique team that is saving the world? Really?I hope MI:8 isn't just another Tom Cruise stunt reel where it looks like they make the story up as the go along, as long as all marks are checked in the end (running, face swapping, dealing with heights etc), and where character development takes a backseat. Bigger is not always better. And the action ALWAYS has to serve the story, not the other way around.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: After the first 30 minutes that promised an intellectual action thriller, the film starts its nosedive into mediocrity by introducing a thief who constantly indulges in disloyalty, for petty gains, towards the IMF and Hunt, but is held in high regards by Hunt. For the life of me, I couldn't understand why. The film also doesn't bother with it.Neither is it concerned with the so called action set pieces. _Fallout_ had plethora of those, one after the other, tied together by a cogent story line. For all its hype, it has 2-3 in a run time of close to 160 minutes, which tested my patience.Reading it's critics' reviews post viewing make me feel as if they have been written by the Entity, the AI behemoth at the center of this. The perceived entertainment value implied by them is not even remotely connected with the reality.It is no wonder that it is faltering at the US box office. It is no Top Gun- Maverick. Crowds are going to turn up, especially outside the US, because of Cruise's star power. But I don't believe this will please most of them.Disappointing.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: An absolute masterclass in producing an enjoyable action movie. Cinematography was great, the story was paced extremely well, and the casting of ALL roles was absolutely perfect.Cruise, Pegg and Rhames were awesome as always, Whigham and Davis were great additions, but the power quartet of Ferguson, Atwell, Klementieff and Kirby, really went above and beyond in making this movie perfect. Not to mention the chilling confidence of Morales as Gabriel, who practically oozes tangible danger.From the pre-opening credits scene to the final act, if you're like me, you will be on the edge of your seat - especially during any fight scene that involves Ferguson or Klementieff - and whilst there are moments that the tempo slows down to advance the story, it is always completely captivating.The single, solitary, disappointment comes as the credits roll, and you remember you're going to have to wait until next year to see how it ends.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Absolutely superb! Was hoping they could do the impossible and surpass Fallout! And Cruise, McQuarrie and co have accomplished this in spades, delivering the best spy/ action thriller in years.It is a next level masterclass of a film, with everything you would expect from an Mission Impossible film and more.The cast are great, with the new additions adding so much to the usual MI crew. The stunts are performed to the usual high standard and give you that Wow feeling you want, The story is fantastic, leaving you wanting more, setting up Part Two really wellGo see this on the best screen possible.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: It should be impossible to fumble the bag so badly on a nostalgia trip movie like this. Just let Tom Cruise run, do some crazy stunts and play the iconic theme music. But no they gotta drag on for three hours with a meaningless storyline just for it to be one part of an incomplete movie. Like whatever happened to movie editing? There's no reason for this movie to be this long and a lot of the content is completely unnecessary to move the plot forward. I don't expect MI movies to have watertight logic but then atleast the writers shouldn't twist themselves into knots thinking they're making a deeper movie than they are, the sooner these movie trends with AI, quantum space tunneling, multiverse nonsense end the better it is for good storylines.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: This latest Mission: Impossible movie is a slam dunk that needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible. Tom Cruise certainly knows how to make a movie. In another universe Cruse could have been Iron Man and I always felt that his aggression with the Mission: Impossible franchise was his way of making up for that. That's probably why the dialog in this movie felt like Ethan Hawk was captain America or something and they are going up against a Bonafede supervillain in the form of an A. I system. As far as I'm concern the best villain of the franchise snice the late and great Phillip Seymour Huffman.The Avengers Assemble as franchise regulars Simon Pegg as Dunn and Ving Rhimes, who I say with glee, started this franchise with Cruse as Luther, make their return as IMF agents. Rebecca Ferguson reprises her role from the last movie and Haley Atwell is in the movie as well, but none of this makes me as happy as Ving still being in the franchise.The action sequences are so good in this picture. It was worth having to stay in me seat for almost three hours just so they can add a little more action in-between the Hero's journey dialogue.And this is just part one!? Part two has some big shoes to fill!\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: I love Tom Cruise movies, but this one feels pretty contrived. Beyond the plot, Grace was the biggest detriment to the movie. The character started out amusing but her shtick became insufferable and Ethan's infatuation idiotic. How they handled Ilsa feels both rushed and cheap, with no emotional weight felt. The biggest stunt was spoiled beforehand which I suppose did its job in getting me in the seat, but totally ruins the moment in film. The final act also lacked any tension and was honestly a little boring - there wasn't any real cleverness.Still, it was humorous throughout, had a good amount of charm and the production value is evident. That's enough for me to be above average but it's unlikely I'll watch the followup in theater.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: As a hardout Mission fan. I can confirm 5 years was definitely worth the wait. The film is extremally charming and filled with exciting humor, action and story-telling. Tom and Hayley really bring the film so much joy and create wonderful chemistry. The chase scene in Rome puts you on the edge of your seat and nothing prepares you for the daring things Tom and Hayley pull off in the train sequence.. Tom really understands the action genre and did not disappoint with this film. There is a perfect blend between foundation building for the story and the action sequences. The film is a beautiful set up to the part 2 coming next year.. Brilliant Watch 100/10.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Straight up Dead Reckoning Part 1 was fine. I think it's the weakest out of the last four instalments.I can't put my finger on one exact thing but it just felt a little underdone compared to the last few M:I and was expecting big things the whole movie. It was a combination of things like the acting felt a little weak I guess, the script was just fine, the action was decent but not great compared to other M:I and to the likes of John Wick that I'm now used to. The plot with the A. I is nothing new but it's always still interesting and especially at a time in the real world where the advancements seem to be heating up but the whole pickpocketing the key for 2 hours also got boring so fast. Too many cliches started piling up. The hand to hand combat was some of the weakest stuff I've seen it a while especially the Venice bridge scene, it looked awful, like I could see the choreography. The best scene for me was the desert storm at the start which really had my attention but everything after that seemed just average.I don't know if everyone else is now completely over their only trick being having someone go as someone else with these masks. It's so boring to me now and at a stage I'm kinda rolling my eyes. I really hope the machine blowing a fuse means we have seen the last of them.Tom Cruise is awesome with the stunts he does and will always have respect for the things him doing them but I really wish they didn't show the motorbike cliff jump scene in the trailer. What you see in the trailer is literally the whole stunt, don't get me wrong it's truly impressive but they showed the whole thing and just completely killed it for me.I'm slightly bummed with this one and just coming off seeing Indian Jones and having a lot more fun watching that. I don't care about runtimes but you have to have me sucked in and the whole time, I felt the time...People will love this movie but M:I may have fizzled out with me a bit after this one.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Greetings again from the darkness. The challenge in continuing the \"Mission: Impossible\" franchise is that fans expect each entry to be \"bigger\" and more awe-inspiring than the last. With the seventh film in the series, and the third straight he has directed, writer-director Christopher McQuarrie and superstar actor and daredevil Tom Cruise have managed to accomplish what seemed unlikely ... they have delivered Ethan Hunt's biggest and grandest mission yet. Prepare to be awed by the action.You should know that this is \"Part One\" and it runs 163 minutes, a full hour longer than most movies, and exponentially more expensive to produce. All this during an age when ultra-high-budget blockbusters are being rumored to be fading from public interest. Of course, we are only one year removed from Tom Cruise's TOP GUN: MAVERICK being credited with 'saving cinema', so stay on alert for a 'sky is falling' panic. McQuarrie co-wrote the script with Erik Jendresen (\"Band of Brothers\"), and they remain faithful to the characters and storylines established by the TV series creator, Bruce Geller.There may never have been an actor more suited to a recurring role than Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt (Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones might be the closest). The story itself is fairly straightforward, even if the item being chased often feels like a MacGuffin. Your questioning of how a 'simple' spy-thriller can be effective is understandable, yet it's fascinating to watch as Ethan Hunt's mission in life as an agent is evaluated, as is the cost he's paid as a man. Providing a contemporary theme, the obscure object of desire is an all-powerful key (actually two parts of a key) based on controlling an all-encompassing Artificial Intelligence (AI).In a twist on a familiar theme (and a classic comedy film), we have Airports, Trains, and EVs, the latter being a tiny Fiat with handcuffs. Still, the car chase is everything we might hope, while the high-tech facial search in the airport sequence delivers the thrills for techie viewers, and the train sparring occurs inside as well as on top. And lest you be worried, there are enough Cruise sprint scenes here to put CHARIOTS OF FIRE to shame.Familiar faces include Ethan Hunt's team of Luther (Ving Rhames, who along with Cruise, has appeared in all 7 MI films), Benji (Simon Pegg), and Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). It's nice to again see (and hear) Henry Czerny as Kittridge, Vanessa Kirby as arms dealer The White Widow, and Esai Morales - as Gabriel, the required villain in search of the same key as our good guys. New faces include Haylee Atwell as master pickpocket Grace, whose soul may or may not be beyond salvation; Cary Elwes as agency director Denlinger; Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis as officers after rogue Hunt; and Pom Klementieff as a hired assassin.The stunt work here is outstanding, and of course, Tom Cruise is renowned for personally handling many of the most breathtaking acts - the most memorable one here being his riding of a motorcycle off a cliff. This stunt has a 'making of' video that's been available for a while. As movie goers, we've never seen anything like it. This part one was originally scheduled for release in 2021 (thanks a lot, COVID), and now Part Two is set for 2024. It's been 27 years since the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE (1996) with Jon Voight ... Cruise was 34 in that one. This particular mission is the biggest yet, and it would certainly be impossible for the rest of us. It's a mission that will be closed out in Part Two, and simultaneously bring an end to Cruise's remarkable run as Ethan Hunt.Opening July 12, 2023.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: This movie started out promising but by the end, it just felt like being robbed of two and a half hours. I am a big fan of the MI movies (including MI2, which people seem to hate) and I could appreciate this movie for the few scenes that it did right, but it treats the audience like idiots in its bland, repetitive storyline (how many times do we need to hear the words \"the key\" and \"the entity\"? It was as if the writers of this movie just gave up on their jobs when they wrote this. Easily the weakest MI movie ever filmed. It had me staring at my watch every 20 minutes. As others have mentioned, the character development in this movie is also truly awful. I have barely any interest in seeing Part Two of Dead Reckoning at this point. The high scores this movie is getting absolutely baffle me. This movie by no means deserves a score higher than a 6 or a 6.5.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Basically, this movie is big, loud, and stupid.Definitely TOO loud, in fact. The music attempts to turn even the most minor scene into some sort of heart-pounding climax.There are endless ridiculous fights in which Tom Cruise is predictably unstoppable, no matter how many opponents he's up against. Slim girls get to beat up multiple men. (Emily Blunt was right when, commenting on a fight in \"Sicario\" in which, refreshingly, she loses to a bigger guy, she noted that Hollywood fight scenes in which 110-pound women whip larger males are \"so cheesy.\")The dull, tepid, way-too-pretty villain is, implausibly, a formidable fighter but sure doesn't look like one. An action movie is only as good as its villain is evil; this guy looks like a French fashion mogul.He and Cruise fight on top of -- wait for it -- a moving train! Haven't we seen that ridiculous sort of thing a hundred times before?The tediously overcomplicated plot makes it hard to keep track of who's on which side, nor do we care. Apparently, as is usual these days, we're supposed to root against the U. S. government.In all scenes involving conversations, virtually EVERY line is merely plot exposition in which characters tell us, in stilted dialogue, what's going on, what's supposed to happen, and how we're supposed to feel.The much-touted parachute jump is actually disappointing. It's over quite fast, and its main source of interest is that, if you've seen the promotional video, you know that Cruise himself actually made that jump.The only truly enjoyable sequence -- the cleverly worked-out rescue attempts on the falling train -- comes at the end, after nearly two and a half hours of empty cartoonish nonsense...Including, of course, an overlong cartoonish car chase, obligatory in dumb summer movies.\n",

It feels huge the whole time however I must say I while the set pieces were stellar, the hand to hand combat scenes were not great and a big step down from the last film (Fallout).Thebeginning is slow with a lot of expository being dumped (more than you'd usually see) but once it gets going it is pretty nonstop.This is a good chapter and Haley Atwell shines but it is nowhere near my favorite of the series.7/10Mi rankingsMi6 Fallout\n",

            "Skipping non-numeric rating: 'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part I (M:I7) is another strong entry in the action/spy series, with Ethan (Cruise) looking slightly older, but not less determined to save the world. I believe the sequel to this film will be his last outing - but we'll see. This time, there's some Skynet-like sentient-AI that's manipulating nefarious types to take over the world, so the IMF team are out to get the two halves of key that can stop it.Isla (Ferguson), Benji (Pegg) and Luther (Rhames) are back, as well as CIA boss Kittridge (Czerny), with Grace (Atwell), a thief, being the newcomer. The bad guys that keep thwarting them are Gabriel (Morales) from Ethan's past, and Paris (Klementieff). The consistency of having McQuarrie as director of the two previous films helps, with everything feeling assured and this working as a really solid follow-up to 'Fallout'.There's some funny moments, some sincere ones, and some of Ethan running, as contractually-obliged. The whole final scene on the train is excellent, with so many things happening, but there's plenty of good set-pieces throughout, including a good car chase. However, the piece-de-resistance is the motorbike off the cliff into a BASE jump is something else. The fact Cruise did it for real, multiple times, is crazy and inspiring.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Man.... I wish I loved this movie more than I did. Don't get me wrong, it's a solid action movie with jaw-dropping stunts (some of the best in the series), but as a Mission: Impossible movie, it felt like a small step backward for the franchise. Fallout had mind-blowing action sequences and stunt work, along with developing Ethan's relationship with Ilsa, providing closure with Julia, showing the lengths Ethan would go to protect those closest to him, and battling an imposing villain. Dead Reckoning: Part One stretches the movie across two films only to seemingly showcase action spectacle after action spectacle while sacrificing character development. Characters I have grown to love over a decade of films felt sidelined, ignored, or wasted. Hayley Atwell's new character chewed up most of the screen time, and while she was fantastic, I wanted to see more of the original team. The new villain had an inconsistent ability that confused more than intimidated. There were some important emotional moments that I just didn't feel the weight of when I definitely should have. Part Two might tie everything together and make me enjoy Part One more in retrospect, but unfortunately, I left wanting more from this one.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Just got out of seeing this movie. I am really disappointed that they totally killed off the potential relationship between Ethan and Ilsa. I am totally OK with her dying but the way that they did it and how anti-climactic it was after building up her character so much in the previous two films. Just seems like she would've deserved a better death than that. Also, what was the point of showing the two characters getting closer to each other, and in the last film, his ex-wife, basically giving them permission to move forward when you're just going to kill her off like that. Honestly, Rebecca Ferguson revised this franchise two movies ago and I think killing off her character was a big mistake. Even in the scenes that she's in it doesn't even seem like she's playing the same person. I wonder if they wrote her out of the movie because she's too busy with the rest of her work. Hayley Atwell's character doesn't make sense to me either. Just put her in the IMF because she can pick some pockets? This all seems forced. Maybe most won't agree, but I think this development totally ruined the movie for me.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Just saw this one in a theatre, and boy... what an adrenaline rush it is. The latest Mission Impossible features some of the most incredible stunts ever put to camera. The story is absolutely exhilarating and continues to bring new life to a veteran movie franchise. The sheer scale of this movie is epic, and with every twist and turn of the movie, you cannot help but marvel at the incredible sets used to bring this movie to life. Such a movie begs to be seen on the biggest screen possible where you can truly feel the grandeur of the film. Tom Cruise has once again delivered one of the best movies of the year, and I cannot recommend that you see it enough!\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: To me, a new M:I film is an event. From Part 4 onwards, they've been spectacular (all 10/10's).There's some good stuff here for sure, and overall it's a solid 8, but it's simply not as good as previous entries.I kept noticing that a lot of scenes had just 2 or 3 people in them, and I kept imagining the crew all masked up, as well as the cast when the camera wasn't on them. It can't be easy to make a huge movie like this during a pandemic, but it definitely shows.The A. I. plot is quite good, and Hunt's as-yet-unknown backstory quite intriguing, but the whole story basically revolves around: \"I've got the key, now she's got the key, now he's got the key\" etc. So much pick-pocketing.Also, I really wish they hadn't ruined the motorcycle jump in the promos. If you've seen the promo, you've seen the scene. There are really only 3 or 4 action sequences, and nothing we haven't really seen before. I actually enjoyed the first desert shoot-out the best.And- oh!- the exposition! There's a scene near the beginning that reminded me of a Neil Breen(!) movie, where powerful people sit in a room and just spout buzz words like \"nuclear war,\" \"economic collapse,\" \"dogs and cats living together\" etc.THAT said, it's still an 8/10. Tom always gives it his best, the rest of the cast is good (especially all four female leads) and I thought the added humour with Hunt's character was a nice touch. I'd rather watch this ten times over than any blatant cyncial Disney cash-grab.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Good God. I feel ashamed for approaching this film with a modicum of doubt that Tom would still be able to deliver. Unbelievably, this epic actually manages to top the brilliant Fallout. Tom is literally going to die if he keeps doing these stunts. The motorbike sequence is utterly ludicrous. Intriguing plot with actual stakes and some familiar faces ably supported by brilliant new allies and villains. Sets up Part II perfectly with a sensational finale that homages Back to the Future 3, MI:1 and Speed. It is funny, action packed, polished and exhilarating. Harrison was great last week, but Tom is still the King. 9/10.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: I was lucky to be able to watch this 4 days before its official release in Czech Republic as a pre-premiere (didn't know such a thing existed) and it was the first time I've felt real excitement to go watch a film at the cinema in ages thanks to the recent genius combination of Fallout and Top Gun 2.I know what they were trying to do with this film. Bringing Kittridge back and a convoluted train finale all harked back to the 1st movie that sparked it all off. Explaining that convoluted storyline along the way harks back to the criticisms made about that same first film.The sky jump stunt was an attempt to beat the stunts from Tom Cruise in previous installments that have now become a beloved trademark of the franchise.But this film unfortunately overall is most reminiscent of the second installment which was Tom Cruise centric and lacked any real impossible mission requiring teamwork, real stakes and ingenious problem solving.In fact, it could have even been intentional that this film reminds the viewer of Mission Impossible 2. The photos in the film of past Ethan Hunt when searching for present Ethan Hunt show him with his longer hair as he looked in that second film.Ultimately, I expected the story to be way better than what we get in this instalment.There are 2 guys that keep appearing at each scene trying to catch Ethan which seems a very cheap simple story.And the very simple plot is explained in long scenes to make it seem way more complicated that it actually is (people complained there should be more explanation in the first film, but at least the plot in the first film actually required brain power), and I have to say that some of the acting is quite poor at times, not helped by some rather cheesy lines in the script, including the lines and accents in the opening Russian submarine sequence.There is also not that much action. 3 main action sequences for a close to 3 hour movie, which are the desert shoot out at the beginning, the Venice car chase, and the train crash at the end.I thought the alleyway fight scene, which some have praised, was really quite subpar and not very enthralling.The best action scene is the Venice car chase because it is genuinely funny (yes, because it is excellently laugh out loud funny, but not in any way tense); I never had the feeling that I was on the edge of my seat.The motorcycle sky jump scene was a major disappointment after the hype because if you didn't know Cruise actually did do that stunt, they used so much CGI that people would just assume it was computer generated. It actually reminded me of Pierce Brosnan's riding the tsunami in Die Another Day (sorry Tom! The stunt is still awesome!).The same for the train at the end. I know they actually made that train, and probably actually threw it off a bridge, but it doesn't look real. Though it is a long action finale and very fun to watch, for me the lack of realism takes away any tension. You are enjoying it for its visual value, but again not feeling any 'wow' factor or tension.At the end of Fallout, for example, you really felt Ethan Hunt was battered, bruised, worn out and still fighting to save humanity. There is none of that.The most tragic thing about this movie is that, unlike in the best of the previous films, we're back to the team being irrelevant in this one. Benji and Luther don't actually do very much.And poor Ilsa. Fallout ended with Ethan's ex-wife essentially giving him permission to move on and be with Ilsa.The relationship between Ilsa and Hunt had been built up over two excellent movies - Rogue Nation and Fallout - and in this film she says almost nothing, looks grumpy and sad all the time, and dies in an anticlimactic fight that is literally spelt out to the audience as a way to replace her with newcomer Grace.Grace, played by Hayley Atwell, is good. A likeable character and a capable actress, but I don't get the story unless Rebecca Ferguson said she wants out the franchise.The film is all about chasing \"the key.\" No twists. No high stakes. There is virtually no grittiness in this outing. It feels very light.Ultimately I was hoping to enjoy a quality film in the franchise. A movie like Oblivion, Edge of Tomorrow, Fallout, Top Gun 2 or American Made that you can show to anyone and say these are recent really high quality films starring this guy called Tom Cruise.This is not one of those films.It is more like The Mummy. It is better than Mission Impossible 2 but not better than any of the others in the franchise.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One confirms that Mission Impossible is the best franchise currently going and possibly ever made. A 2 hour 43 minute adrenaline rush that contains some of the best action sequences put to film, embarrasses the majority of the competition out there and sets the stage for a magnificent part 2 whilst still being a satisfying adventure in its own right.This is possibly the most open and obvious a Mission film has been with its deeper meaning for cinema and what aspect of Cruise's career is being dissected this time with a film that focuses on Ethan's relationship with women and basically outright declares AI to be a soulless monster and how the human element is always needed (perfect film to release during a writer's strike).Tom Cruise is perfect as Ethan Hunt and the strongest aspect this time round is when the film explores what made Ethan who he is and reminds you he genuinely cares about his team but that comes at a cost. Physically, the madman is still going strong with his stunts, driving a bike off a cliff in truly breathtaking fashion.Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg and Rebecca Ferguson remain the best IMF team and all play to their strengths here. The longer this series goes on the more authentic their growing friendship feels. Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis get more than expected and their buddy cop antics are a lot of fun.With Esai Morales' charismatic yet terrifying Gabriel and Pom Klementieff's terrific henchman of few words, this franchise finally has more good villains than bad. The return of Henry Czerny as Kittridge is glorious and he remains as gleefully despicable as his first appearance.The best new addition is easily Hayley Atwell. She plays a type of character never seen before in these films which makes her character and dynamic with Cruise fresh in comparison to everyone who's come before and their chemistry is magnetic. Instantaneous from the second they interact.Christopher McQuarrie's direction is phenomenal. The action sequences are suitably practical (this is how you spend $290 million), and the camera gets as close to the action as humanly possible, he remains one of the best in the business working at this scale. There's plenty of canted angles as a nice homage to De Palma's original and it helps give this one its own style in comparison to McQuarrie's previous entries.The pacing is really impressive with the film feeling like it's in a perpetual third act from its first airport heist (which is so much fun). Lorne Balfe does the music once again and yet again it's a highlight of the film, he knows how to elevate everything so well and really hammers home the emotional beats.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Ethan Hunt has left the mere secret agent status and has ascended to the all living perfect messiah.There is so much wrong with this movie, which seriously pains me because I seriously love this series. The mission impossible movies have steadily become more convoluted and more stupidly written. This film reaches the peak of absurdity, feeling more like an over the top fast and furious movie. All foolish action, cheap parlor tricks to pull the heart strings (empty relationships), horrible writing, poor plot development.I mean seriously what ever happened to show don't tell?! This is becoming rather ridiculous.*convoluted villain dialogue*\n",
            "\"So what you're telling me is you plan to establish a new world order if you get that key and if someone stops you that would be bad?!\"Has Ethan Hunt suddenly become this vanilla James Bond? With the Bond girl cycling through every few films? Lazy writing. Not natural feeling. Forced. BlighIt pains me to give this so low.The truth is, this movie is mindless entertaining action. Tom Cruise delivers on some awesome stunts (seldom compared to other MI films). It's not horrible. It's fun entertainment, but a scour on the (in my opinion) reputable authentic feeling mission impossible series.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: So you probably watched IM 6 and said, they can't make it any better can they? Or Top Gun 2, guess again, this is an adrenaline action movie with a good story, well written, action scenes that just blow you away, not a boring moment and you are on the edge of your seat all the time, this is how you make movies! Tom Cruise did it again, WOW!! It's an exhausting ride he takes you on, man I forgot to eat my popcorn and by the time i finally wanted some my wife had eaten all of it, but hey I was so immersed into the movie that time stood still and i forgot everything around me.Go and see it, this one gets my full recommendation, the only reason it's not a 10 is due to the fact it's not a completely new type of movie, however this one is done as a good action movie should be made, i don't see how they could have made it better, I really can't, go watch it and have a good time while you do it, it will put a big smile on your face that's for sure.\n",

Thus I am quite disappointed on how this mission never seemed too difficult , let alone impossible.Action was okay. Car chase was funny, but not exciting. Jumping off the cliff seemed forced to me. Why would you keep driving uphill when you can take short cuts to reach the train. It wasn't even a fast train. The key kept being stolen from pockets too many times which makes you wonder how lazy the scripting was. Kill old gf to make new gf was also lazy writing.Unlike other MIs, Ethan had no single smart move or plan. It felt more like let's go and see what happens.Am not sure how MI fans ignored all these weaknesses and gave this film 8+ rating.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: This was a great movie. However, it lost a star from me for making the audience believe Ilsa is dead. They've spent two films building up Ilsa as being Ethan's equal, and hinted at an eventual romance. She's been able to fight off multiple men bare-handed yet she meets her demise by one guy when she has a sword? Then they brush past her death like it means nothing, only for her to be replaced by a new woman. I thought it was a huge disservice to the character.I know Rebecca Ferguson is very busy so she might have asked to leave, but I'm hoping this isn't the end for my favorite character in these films. She deserves a happy ending, or at least a better death than the one she received in this movie. It really took me out of the rest of the film. Hopefully, we'll see her again in Part Two.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Remember that classic MI scene where they broke in at CIA, and Cruise was hanging from the ceiling using wires? It's not a huge setpiece, but that scene is a nailbiting example of ingenious problem solving.In 'Dead Reckoning' there's none of that. Here it's keys changing hands every 10 minutes that is suppose to pass as suspense. And of course the only true selling point: the stunts performed by Tom Cruise.But I want and expect more than that.A large part of the film is devoted to people sitting or standing in a room, explaining what the plot is. Endless talking and explaining. We are told in several scenes the same information we just heard. Worst one is Benji, who is merely there to repeat things for someone in the cast, to make sure everyone in the audience knows what is going on. That is sloppy writing. One of the biggest no-no's as a screenwriter is resolving to \"so what you are saying is, that...\" info sharing. Benji does this all the time. And he is as incompetent as usual. And he is supposed to be a part of a small and unique team that is saving the world? Really?I hope MI:8 isn't just another Tom Cruise stunt reel where it looks like they make the story up as the go along, as long as all marks are checked in the end (running, face swapping, dealing with heights etc), and where character development takes a backseat. Bigger is not always better. And the action ALWAYS has to serve the story, not the other way around.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: After the first 30 minutes that promised an intellectual action thriller, the film starts its nosedive into mediocrity by introducing a thief who constantly indulges in disloyalty, for petty gains, towards the IMF and Hunt, but is held in high regards by Hunt. For the life of me, I couldn't understand why. The film also doesn't bother with it.Neither is it concerned with the so called action set pieces. _Fallout_ had plethora of those, one after the other, tied together by a cogent story line. For all its hype, it has 2-3 in a run time of close to 160 minutes, which tested my patience.Reading it's critics' reviews post viewing make me feel as if they have been written by the Entity, the AI behemoth at the center of this. The perceived entertainment value implied by them is not even remotely connected with the reality.It is no wonder that it is faltering at the US box office. It is no Top Gun- Maverick. Crowds are going to turn up, especially outside the US, because of Cruise's star power. But I don't believe this will please most of them.Disappointing.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: An absolute masterclass in producing an enjoyable action movie. Cinematography was great, the story was paced extremely well, and the casting of ALL roles was absolutely perfect.Cruise, Pegg and Rhames were awesome as always, Whigham and Davis were great additions, but the power quartet of Ferguson, Atwell, Klementieff and Kirby, really went above and beyond in making this movie perfect. Not to mention the chilling confidence of Morales as Gabriel, who practically oozes tangible danger.From the pre-opening credits scene to the final act, if you're like me, you will be on the edge of your seat - especially during any fight scene that involves Ferguson or Klementieff - and whilst there are moments that the tempo slows down to advance the story, it is always completely captivating.The single, solitary, disappointment comes as the credits roll, and you remember you're going to have to wait until next year to see how it ends.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Absolutely superb! Was hoping they could do the impossible and surpass Fallout! And Cruise, McQuarrie and co have accomplished this in spades, delivering the best spy/ action thriller in years.It is a next level masterclass of a film, with everything you would expect from an Mission Impossible film and more.The cast are great, with the new additions adding so much to the usual MI crew. The stunts are performed to the usual high standard and give you that Wow feeling you want, The story is fantastic, leaving you wanting more, setting up Part Two really wellGo see this on the best screen possible.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: It should be impossible to fumble the bag so badly on a nostalgia trip movie like this. Just let Tom Cruise run, do some crazy stunts and play the iconic theme music. But no they gotta drag on for three hours with a meaningless storyline just for it to be one part of an incomplete movie. Like whatever happened to movie editing? There's no reason for this movie to be this long and a lot of the content is completely unnecessary to move the plot forward. I don't expect MI movies to have watertight logic but then atleast the writers shouldn't twist themselves into knots thinking they're making a deeper movie than they are, the sooner these movie trends with AI, quantum space tunneling, multiverse nonsense end the better it is for good storylines.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: This latest Mission: Impossible movie is a slam dunk that needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible. Tom Cruise certainly knows how to make a movie. In another universe Cruse could have been Iron Man and I always felt that his aggression with the Mission: Impossible franchise was his way of making up for that. That's probably why the dialog in this movie felt like Ethan Hawk was captain America or something and they are going up against a Bonafede supervillain in the form of an A. I system. As far as I'm concern the best villain of the franchise snice the late and great Phillip Seymour Huffman.The Avengers Assemble as franchise regulars Simon Pegg as Dunn and Ving Rhimes, who I say with glee, started this franchise with Cruse as Luther, make their return as IMF agents. Rebecca Ferguson reprises her role from the last movie and Haley Atwell is in the movie as well, but none of this makes me as happy as Ving still being in the franchise.The action sequences are so good in this picture. It was worth having to stay in me seat for almost three hours just so they can add a little more action in-between the Hero's journey dialogue.And this is just part one!? Part two has some big shoes to fill!\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: I love Tom Cruise movies, but this one feels pretty contrived. Beyond the plot, Grace was the biggest detriment to the movie. The character started out amusing but her shtick became insufferable and Ethan's infatuation idiotic. How they handled Ilsa feels both rushed and cheap, with no emotional weight felt. The biggest stunt was spoiled beforehand which I suppose did its job in getting me in the seat, but totally ruins the moment in film. The final act also lacked any tension and was honestly a little boring - there wasn't any real cleverness.Still, it was humorous throughout, had a good amount of charm and the production value is evident. That's enough for me to be above average but it's unlikely I'll watch the followup in theater.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: As a hardout Mission fan. I can confirm 5 years was definitely worth the wait. The film is extremally charming and filled with exciting humor, action and story-telling. Tom and Hayley really bring the film so much joy and create wonderful chemistry. The chase scene in Rome puts you on the edge of your seat and nothing prepares you for the daring things Tom and Hayley pull off in the train sequence.. Tom really understands the action genre and did not disappoint with this film. There is a perfect blend between foundation building for the story and the action sequences. The film is a beautiful set up to the part 2 coming next year.. Brilliant Watch 100/10.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Straight up Dead Reckoning Part 1 was fine. I think it's the weakest out of the last four instalments.I can't put my finger on one exact thing but it just felt a little underdone compared to the last few M:I and was expecting big things the whole movie. It was a combination of things like the acting felt a little weak I guess, the script was just fine, the action was decent but not great compared to other M:I and to the likes of John Wick that I'm now used to. The plot with the A. I is nothing new but it's always still interesting and especially at a time in the real world where the advancements seem to be heating up but the whole pickpocketing the key for 2 hours also got boring so fast. Too many cliches started piling up. The hand to hand combat was some of the weakest stuff I've seen it a while especially the Venice bridge scene, it looked awful, like I could see the choreography. The best scene for me was the desert storm at the start which really had my attention but everything after that seemed just average.I don't know if everyone else is now completely over their only trick being having someone go as someone else with these masks. It's so boring to me now and at a stage I'm kinda rolling my eyes. I really hope the machine blowing a fuse means we have seen the last of them.Tom Cruise is awesome with the stunts he does and will always have respect for the things him doing them but I really wish they didn't show the motorbike cliff jump scene in the trailer. What you see in the trailer is literally the whole stunt, don't get me wrong it's truly impressive but they showed the whole thing and just completely killed it for me.I'm slightly bummed with this one and just coming off seeing Indian Jones and having a lot more fun watching that. I don't care about runtimes but you have to have me sucked in and the whole time, I felt the time...People will love this movie but M:I may have fizzled out with me a bit after this one.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Greetings again from the darkness. The challenge in continuing the \"Mission: Impossible\" franchise is that fans expect each entry to be \"bigger\" and more awe-inspiring than the last. With the seventh film in the series, and the third straight he has directed, writer-director Christopher McQuarrie and superstar actor and daredevil Tom Cruise have managed to accomplish what seemed unlikely ... they have delivered Ethan Hunt's biggest and grandest mission yet. Prepare to be awed by the action.You should know that this is \"Part One\" and it runs 163 minutes, a full hour longer than most movies, and exponentially more expensive to produce. All this during an age when ultra-high-budget blockbusters are being rumored to be fading from public interest. Of course, we are only one year removed from Tom Cruise's TOP GUN: MAVERICK being credited with 'saving cinema', so stay on alert for a 'sky is falling' panic. McQuarrie co-wrote the script with Erik Jendresen (\"Band of Brothers\"), and they remain faithful to the characters and storylines established by the TV series creator, Bruce Geller.There may never have been an actor more suited to a recurring role than Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt (Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones might be the closest). The story itself is fairly straightforward, even if the item being chased often feels like a MacGuffin. Your questioning of how a 'simple' spy-thriller can be effective is understandable, yet it's fascinating to watch as Ethan Hunt's mission in life as an agent is evaluated, as is the cost he's paid as a man. Providing a contemporary theme, the obscure object of desire is an all-powerful key (actually two parts of a key) based on controlling an all-encompassing Artificial Intelligence (AI).In a twist on a familiar theme (and a classic comedy film), we have Airports, Trains, and EVs, the latter being a tiny Fiat with handcuffs. Still, the car chase is everything we might hope, while the high-tech facial search in the airport sequence delivers the thrills for techie viewers, and the train sparring occurs inside as well as on top. And lest you be worried, there are enough Cruise sprint scenes here to put CHARIOTS OF FIRE to shame.Familiar faces include Ethan Hunt's team of Luther (Ving Rhames, who along with Cruise, has appeared in all 7 MI films), Benji (Simon Pegg), and Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). It's nice to again see (and hear) Henry Czerny as Kittridge, Vanessa Kirby as arms dealer The White Widow, and Esai Morales - as Gabriel, the required villain in search of the same key as our good guys. New faces include Haylee Atwell as master pickpocket Grace, whose soul may or may not be beyond salvation; Cary Elwes as agency director Denlinger; Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis as officers after rogue Hunt; and Pom Klementieff as a hired assassin.The stunt work here is outstanding, and of course, Tom Cruise is renowned for personally handling many of the most breathtaking acts - the most memorable one here being his riding of a motorcycle off a cliff. This stunt has a 'making of' video that's been available for a while. As movie goers, we've never seen anything like it. This part one was originally scheduled for release in 2021 (thanks a lot, COVID), and now Part Two is set for 2024. It's been 27 years since the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE (1996) with Jon Voight ... Cruise was 34 in that one. This particular mission is the biggest yet, and it would certainly be impossible for the rest of us. It's a mission that will be closed out in Part Two, and simultaneously bring an end to Cruise's remarkable run as Ethan Hunt.Opening July 12, 2023.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: This movie started out promising but by the end, it just felt like being robbed of two and a half hours. I am a big fan of the MI movies (including MI2, which people seem to hate) and I could appreciate this movie for the few scenes that it did right, but it treats the audience like idiots in its bland, repetitive storyline (how many times do we need to hear the words \"the key\" and \"the entity\"? It was as if the writers of this movie just gave up on their jobs when they wrote this. Easily the weakest MI movie ever filmed. It had me staring at my watch every 20 minutes. As others have mentioned, the character development in this movie is also truly awful. I have barely any interest in seeing Part Two of Dead Reckoning at this point. The high scores this movie is getting absolutely baffle me. This movie by no means deserves a score higher than a 6 or a 6.5.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Basically, this movie is big, loud, and stupid.Definitely TOO loud, in fact. The music attempts to turn even the most minor scene into some sort of heart-pounding climax.There are endless ridiculous fights in which Tom Cruise is predictably unstoppable, no matter how many opponents he's up against. Slim girls get to beat up multiple men. (Emily Blunt was right when, commenting on a fight in \"Sicario\" in which, refreshingly, she loses to a bigger guy, she noted that Hollywood fight scenes in which 110-pound women whip larger males are \"so cheesy.\")The dull, tepid, way-too-pretty villain is, implausibly, a formidable fighter but sure doesn't look like one. An action movie is only as good as its villain is evil; this guy looks like a French fashion mogul.He and Cruise fight on top of -- wait for it -- a moving train! Haven't we seen that ridiculous sort of thing a hundred times before?The tediously overcomplicated plot makes it hard to keep track of who's on which side, nor do we care. Apparently, as is usual these days, we're supposed to root against the U. S. government.In all scenes involving conversations, virtually EVERY line is merely plot exposition in which characters tell us, in stilted dialogue, what's going on, what's supposed to happen, and how we're supposed to feel.The much-touted parachute jump is actually disappointing. It's over quite fast, and its main source of interest is that, if you've seen the promotional video, you know that Cruise himself actually made that jump.The only truly enjoyable sequence -- the cleverly worked-out rescue attempts on the falling train -- comes at the end, after nearly two and a half hours of empty cartoonish nonsense...Including, of course, an overlong cartoonish car chase, obligatory in dumb summer movies.\n",

It feels huge the whole time however I must say I while the set pieces were stellar, the hand to hand combat scenes were not great and a big step down from the last film (Fallout).Thebeginning is slow with a lot of expository being dumped (more than you'd usually see) but once it gets going it is pretty nonstop.This is a good chapter and Haley Atwell shines but it is nowhere near my favorite of the series.7/10Mi rankingsMi6 Fallout\n",

            "Skipping non-numeric rating: 'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part I (M:I7) is another strong entry in the action/spy series, with Ethan (Cruise) looking slightly older, but not less determined to save the world. I believe the sequel to this film will be his last outing - but we'll see. This time, there's some Skynet-like sentient-AI that's manipulating nefarious types to take over the world, so the IMF team are out to get the two halves of key that can stop it.Isla (Ferguson), Benji (Pegg) and Luther (Rhames) are back, as well as CIA boss Kittridge (Czerny), with Grace (Atwell), a thief, being the newcomer. The bad guys that keep thwarting them are Gabriel (Morales) from Ethan's past, and Paris (Klementieff). The consistency of having McQuarrie as director of the two previous films helps, with everything feeling assured and this working as a really solid follow-up to 'Fallout'.There's some funny moments, some sincere ones, and some of Ethan running, as contractually-obliged. The whole final scene on the train is excellent, with so many things happening, but there's plenty of good set-pieces throughout, including a good car chase. However, the piece-de-resistance is the motorbike off the cliff into a BASE jump is something else. The fact Cruise did it for real, multiple times, is crazy and inspiring.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Man.... I wish I loved this movie more than I did. Don't get me wrong, it's a solid action movie with jaw-dropping stunts (some of the best in the series), but as a Mission: Impossible movie, it felt like a small step backward for the franchise. Fallout had mind-blowing action sequences and stunt work, along with developing Ethan's relationship with Ilsa, providing closure with Julia, showing the lengths Ethan would go to protect those closest to him, and battling an imposing villain. Dead Reckoning: Part One stretches the movie across two films only to seemingly showcase action spectacle after action spectacle while sacrificing character development. Characters I have grown to love over a decade of films felt sidelined, ignored, or wasted. Hayley Atwell's new character chewed up most of the screen time, and while she was fantastic, I wanted to see more of the original team. The new villain had an inconsistent ability that confused more than intimidated. There were some important emotional moments that I just didn't feel the weight of when I definitely should have. Part Two might tie everything together and make me enjoy Part One more in retrospect, but unfortunately, I left wanting more from this one.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Just got out of seeing this movie. I am really disappointed that they totally killed off the potential relationship between Ethan and Ilsa. I am totally OK with her dying but the way that they did it and how anti-climactic it was after building up her character so much in the previous two films. Just seems like she would've deserved a better death than that. Also, what was the point of showing the two characters getting closer to each other, and in the last film, his ex-wife, basically giving them permission to move forward when you're just going to kill her off like that. Honestly, Rebecca Ferguson revised this franchise two movies ago and I think killing off her character was a big mistake. Even in the scenes that she's in it doesn't even seem like she's playing the same person. I wonder if they wrote her out of the movie because she's too busy with the rest of her work. Hayley Atwell's character doesn't make sense to me either. Just put her in the IMF because she can pick some pockets? This all seems forced. Maybe most won't agree, but I think this development totally ruined the movie for me.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Just saw this one in a theatre, and boy... what an adrenaline rush it is. The latest Mission Impossible features some of the most incredible stunts ever put to camera. The story is absolutely exhilarating and continues to bring new life to a veteran movie franchise. The sheer scale of this movie is epic, and with every twist and turn of the movie, you cannot help but marvel at the incredible sets used to bring this movie to life. Such a movie begs to be seen on the biggest screen possible where you can truly feel the grandeur of the film. Tom Cruise has once again delivered one of the best movies of the year, and I cannot recommend that you see it enough!\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: To me, a new M:I film is an event. From Part 4 onwards, they've been spectacular (all 10/10's).There's some good stuff here for sure, and overall it's a solid 8, but it's simply not as good as previous entries.I kept noticing that a lot of scenes had just 2 or 3 people in them, and I kept imagining the crew all masked up, as well as the cast when the camera wasn't on them. It can't be easy to make a huge movie like this during a pandemic, but it definitely shows.The A. I. plot is quite good, and Hunt's as-yet-unknown backstory quite intriguing, but the whole story basically revolves around: \"I've got the key, now she's got the key, now he's got the key\" etc. So much pick-pocketing.Also, I really wish they hadn't ruined the motorcycle jump in the promos. If you've seen the promo, you've seen the scene. There are really only 3 or 4 action sequences, and nothing we haven't really seen before. I actually enjoyed the first desert shoot-out the best.And- oh!- the exposition! There's a scene near the beginning that reminded me of a Neil Breen(!) movie, where powerful people sit in a room and just spout buzz words like \"nuclear war,\" \"economic collapse,\" \"dogs and cats living together\" etc.THAT said, it's still an 8/10. Tom always gives it his best, the rest of the cast is good (especially all four female leads) and I thought the added humour with Hunt's character was a nice touch. I'd rather watch this ten times over than any blatant cyncial Disney cash-grab.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Good God. I feel ashamed for approaching this film with a modicum of doubt that Tom would still be able to deliver. Unbelievably, this epic actually manages to top the brilliant Fallout. Tom is literally going to die if he keeps doing these stunts. The motorbike sequence is utterly ludicrous. Intriguing plot with actual stakes and some familiar faces ably supported by brilliant new allies and villains. Sets up Part II perfectly with a sensational finale that homages Back to the Future 3, MI:1 and Speed. It is funny, action packed, polished and exhilarating. Harrison was great last week, but Tom is still the King. 9/10.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: I was lucky to be able to watch this 4 days before its official release in Czech Republic as a pre-premiere (didn't know such a thing existed) and it was the first time I've felt real excitement to go watch a film at the cinema in ages thanks to the recent genius combination of Fallout and Top Gun 2.I know what they were trying to do with this film. Bringing Kittridge back and a convoluted train finale all harked back to the 1st movie that sparked it all off. Explaining that convoluted storyline along the way harks back to the criticisms made about that same first film.The sky jump stunt was an attempt to beat the stunts from Tom Cruise in previous installments that have now become a beloved trademark of the franchise.But this film unfortunately overall is most reminiscent of the second installment which was Tom Cruise centric and lacked any real impossible mission requiring teamwork, real stakes and ingenious problem solving.In fact, it could have even been intentional that this film reminds the viewer of Mission Impossible 2. The photos in the film of past Ethan Hunt when searching for present Ethan Hunt show him with his longer hair as he looked in that second film.Ultimately, I expected the story to be way better than what we get in this instalment.There are 2 guys that keep appearing at each scene trying to catch Ethan which seems a very cheap simple story.And the very simple plot is explained in long scenes to make it seem way more complicated that it actually is (people complained there should be more explanation in the first film, but at least the plot in the first film actually required brain power), and I have to say that some of the acting is quite poor at times, not helped by some rather cheesy lines in the script, including the lines and accents in the opening Russian submarine sequence.There is also not that much action. 3 main action sequences for a close to 3 hour movie, which are the desert shoot out at the beginning, the Venice car chase, and the train crash at the end.I thought the alleyway fight scene, which some have praised, was really quite subpar and not very enthralling.The best action scene is the Venice car chase because it is genuinely funny (yes, because it is excellently laugh out loud funny, but not in any way tense); I never had the feeling that I was on the edge of my seat.The motorcycle sky jump scene was a major disappointment after the hype because if you didn't know Cruise actually did do that stunt, they used so much CGI that people would just assume it was computer generated. It actually reminded me of Pierce Brosnan's riding the tsunami in Die Another Day (sorry Tom! The stunt is still awesome!).The same for the train at the end. I know they actually made that train, and probably actually threw it off a bridge, but it doesn't look real. Though it is a long action finale and very fun to watch, for me the lack of realism takes away any tension. You are enjoying it for its visual value, but again not feeling any 'wow' factor or tension.At the end of Fallout, for example, you really felt Ethan Hunt was battered, bruised, worn out and still fighting to save humanity. There is none of that.The most tragic thing about this movie is that, unlike in the best of the previous films, we're back to the team being irrelevant in this one. Benji and Luther don't actually do very much.And poor Ilsa. Fallout ended with Ethan's ex-wife essentially giving him permission to move on and be with Ilsa.The relationship between Ilsa and Hunt had been built up over two excellent movies - Rogue Nation and Fallout - and in this film she says almost nothing, looks grumpy and sad all the time, and dies in an anticlimactic fight that is literally spelt out to the audience as a way to replace her with newcomer Grace.Grace, played by Hayley Atwell, is good. A likeable character and a capable actress, but I don't get the story unless Rebecca Ferguson said she wants out the franchise.The film is all about chasing \"the key.\" No twists. No high stakes. There is virtually no grittiness in this outing. It feels very light.Ultimately I was hoping to enjoy a quality film in the franchise. A movie like Oblivion, Edge of Tomorrow, Fallout, Top Gun 2 or American Made that you can show to anyone and say these are recent really high quality films starring this guy called Tom Cruise.This is not one of those films.It is more like The Mummy. It is better than Mission Impossible 2 but not better than any of the others in the franchise.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One confirms that Mission Impossible is the best franchise currently going and possibly ever made. A 2 hour 43 minute adrenaline rush that contains some of the best action sequences put to film, embarrasses the majority of the competition out there and sets the stage for a magnificent part 2 whilst still being a satisfying adventure in its own right.This is possibly the most open and obvious a Mission film has been with its deeper meaning for cinema and what aspect of Cruise's career is being dissected this time with a film that focuses on Ethan's relationship with women and basically outright declares AI to be a soulless monster and how the human element is always needed (perfect film to release during a writer's strike).Tom Cruise is perfect as Ethan Hunt and the strongest aspect this time round is when the film explores what made Ethan who he is and reminds you he genuinely cares about his team but that comes at a cost. Physically, the madman is still going strong with his stunts, driving a bike off a cliff in truly breathtaking fashion.Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg and Rebecca Ferguson remain the best IMF team and all play to their strengths here. The longer this series goes on the more authentic their growing friendship feels. Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis get more than expected and their buddy cop antics are a lot of fun.With Esai Morales' charismatic yet terrifying Gabriel and Pom Klementieff's terrific henchman of few words, this franchise finally has more good villains than bad. The return of Henry Czerny as Kittridge is glorious and he remains as gleefully despicable as his first appearance.The best new addition is easily Hayley Atwell. She plays a type of character never seen before in these films which makes her character and dynamic with Cruise fresh in comparison to everyone who's come before and their chemistry is magnetic. Instantaneous from the second they interact.Christopher McQuarrie's direction is phenomenal. The action sequences are suitably practical (this is how you spend $290 million), and the camera gets as close to the action as humanly possible, he remains one of the best in the business working at this scale. There's plenty of canted angles as a nice homage to De Palma's original and it helps give this one its own style in comparison to McQuarrie's previous entries.The pacing is really impressive with the film feeling like it's in a perpetual third act from its first airport heist (which is so much fun). Lorne Balfe does the music once again and yet again it's a highlight of the film, he knows how to elevate everything so well and really hammers home the emotional beats.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Ethan Hunt has left the mere secret agent status and has ascended to the all living perfect messiah.There is so much wrong with this movie, which seriously pains me because I seriously love this series. The mission impossible movies have steadily become more convoluted and more stupidly written. This film reaches the peak of absurdity, feeling more like an over the top fast and furious movie. All foolish action, cheap parlor tricks to pull the heart strings (empty relationships), horrible writing, poor plot development.I mean seriously what ever happened to show don't tell?! This is becoming rather ridiculous.*convoluted villain dialogue*\n",
            "\"So what you're telling me is you plan to establish a new world order if you get that key and if someone stops you that would be bad?!\"Has Ethan Hunt suddenly become this vanilla James Bond? With the Bond girl cycling through every few films? Lazy writing. Not natural feeling. Forced. BlighIt pains me to give this so low.The truth is, this movie is mindless entertaining action. Tom Cruise delivers on some awesome stunts (seldom compared to other MI films). It's not horrible. It's fun entertainment, but a scour on the (in my opinion) reputable authentic feeling mission impossible series.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: So you probably watched IM 6 and said, they can't make it any better can they? Or Top Gun 2, guess again, this is an adrenaline action movie with a good story, well written, action scenes that just blow you away, not a boring moment and you are on the edge of your seat all the time, this is how you make movies! Tom Cruise did it again, WOW!! It's an exhausting ride he takes you on, man I forgot to eat my popcorn and by the time i finally wanted some my wife had eaten all of it, but hey I was so immersed into the movie that time stood still and i forgot everything around me.Go and see it, this one gets my full recommendation, the only reason it's not a 10 is due to the fact it's not a completely new type of movie, however this one is done as a good action movie should be made, i don't see how they could have made it better, I really can't, go watch it and have a good time while you do it, it will put a big smile on your face that's for sure.\n",

Thus I am quite disappointed on how this mission never seemed too difficult , let alone impossible.Action was okay. Car chase was funny, but not exciting. Jumping off the cliff seemed forced to me. Why would you keep driving uphill when you can take short cuts to reach the train. It wasn't even a fast train. The key kept being stolen from pockets too many times which makes you wonder how lazy the scripting was. Kill old gf to make new gf was also lazy writing.Unlike other MIs, Ethan had no single smart move or plan. It felt more like let's go and see what happens.Am not sure how MI fans ignored all these weaknesses and gave this film 8+ rating.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: This was a great movie. However, it lost a star from me for making the audience believe Ilsa is dead. They've spent two films building up Ilsa as being Ethan's equal, and hinted at an eventual romance. She's been able to fight off multiple men bare-handed yet she meets her demise by one guy when she has a sword? Then they brush past her death like it means nothing, only for her to be replaced by a new woman. I thought it was a huge disservice to the character.I know Rebecca Ferguson is very busy so she might have asked to leave, but I'm hoping this isn't the end for my favorite character in these films. She deserves a happy ending, or at least a better death than the one she received in this movie. It really took me out of the rest of the film. Hopefully, we'll see her again in Part Two.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Remember that classic MI scene where they broke in at CIA, and Cruise was hanging from the ceiling using wires? It's not a huge setpiece, but that scene is a nailbiting example of ingenious problem solving.In 'Dead Reckoning' there's none of that. Here it's keys changing hands every 10 minutes that is suppose to pass as suspense. And of course the only true selling point: the stunts performed by Tom Cruise.But I want and expect more than that.A large part of the film is devoted to people sitting or standing in a room, explaining what the plot is. Endless talking and explaining. We are told in several scenes the same information we just heard. Worst one is Benji, who is merely there to repeat things for someone in the cast, to make sure everyone in the audience knows what is going on. That is sloppy writing. One of the biggest no-no's as a screenwriter is resolving to \"so what you are saying is, that...\" info sharing. Benji does this all the time. And he is as incompetent as usual. And he is supposed to be a part of a small and unique team that is saving the world? Really?I hope MI:8 isn't just another Tom Cruise stunt reel where it looks like they make the story up as the go along, as long as all marks are checked in the end (running, face swapping, dealing with heights etc), and where character development takes a backseat. Bigger is not always better. And the action ALWAYS has to serve the story, not the other way around.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: After the first 30 minutes that promised an intellectual action thriller, the film starts its nosedive into mediocrity by introducing a thief who constantly indulges in disloyalty, for petty gains, towards the IMF and Hunt, but is held in high regards by Hunt. For the life of me, I couldn't understand why. The film also doesn't bother with it.Neither is it concerned with the so called action set pieces. _Fallout_ had plethora of those, one after the other, tied together by a cogent story line. For all its hype, it has 2-3 in a run time of close to 160 minutes, which tested my patience.Reading it's critics' reviews post viewing make me feel as if they have been written by the Entity, the AI behemoth at the center of this. The perceived entertainment value implied by them is not even remotely connected with the reality.It is no wonder that it is faltering at the US box office. It is no Top Gun- Maverick. Crowds are going to turn up, especially outside the US, because of Cruise's star power. But I don't believe this will please most of them.Disappointing.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: An absolute masterclass in producing an enjoyable action movie. Cinematography was great, the story was paced extremely well, and the casting of ALL roles was absolutely perfect.Cruise, Pegg and Rhames were awesome as always, Whigham and Davis were great additions, but the power quartet of Ferguson, Atwell, Klementieff and Kirby, really went above and beyond in making this movie perfect. Not to mention the chilling confidence of Morales as Gabriel, who practically oozes tangible danger.From the pre-opening credits scene to the final act, if you're like me, you will be on the edge of your seat - especially during any fight scene that involves Ferguson or Klementieff - and whilst there are moments that the tempo slows down to advance the story, it is always completely captivating.The single, solitary, disappointment comes as the credits roll, and you remember you're going to have to wait until next year to see how it ends.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Absolutely superb! Was hoping they could do the impossible and surpass Fallout! And Cruise, McQuarrie and co have accomplished this in spades, delivering the best spy/ action thriller in years.It is a next level masterclass of a film, with everything you would expect from an Mission Impossible film and more.The cast are great, with the new additions adding so much to the usual MI crew. The stunts are performed to the usual high standard and give you that Wow feeling you want, The story is fantastic, leaving you wanting more, setting up Part Two really wellGo see this on the best screen possible.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: It should be impossible to fumble the bag so badly on a nostalgia trip movie like this. Just let Tom Cruise run, do some crazy stunts and play the iconic theme music. But no they gotta drag on for three hours with a meaningless storyline just for it to be one part of an incomplete movie. Like whatever happened to movie editing? There's no reason for this movie to be this long and a lot of the content is completely unnecessary to move the plot forward. I don't expect MI movies to have watertight logic but then atleast the writers shouldn't twist themselves into knots thinking they're making a deeper movie than they are, the sooner these movie trends with AI, quantum space tunneling, multiverse nonsense end the better it is for good storylines.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: This latest Mission: Impossible movie is a slam dunk that needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible. Tom Cruise certainly knows how to make a movie. In another universe Cruse could have been Iron Man and I always felt that his aggression with the Mission: Impossible franchise was his way of making up for that. That's probably why the dialog in this movie felt like Ethan Hawk was captain America or something and they are going up against a Bonafede supervillain in the form of an A. I system. As far as I'm concern the best villain of the franchise snice the late and great Phillip Seymour Huffman.The Avengers Assemble as franchise regulars Simon Pegg as Dunn and Ving Rhimes, who I say with glee, started this franchise with Cruse as Luther, make their return as IMF agents. Rebecca Ferguson reprises her role from the last movie and Haley Atwell is in the movie as well, but none of this makes me as happy as Ving still being in the franchise.The action sequences are so good in this picture. It was worth having to stay in me seat for almost three hours just so they can add a little more action in-between the Hero's journey dialogue.And this is just part one!? Part two has some big shoes to fill!\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: I love Tom Cruise movies, but this one feels pretty contrived. Beyond the plot, Grace was the biggest detriment to the movie. The character started out amusing but her shtick became insufferable and Ethan's infatuation idiotic. How they handled Ilsa feels both rushed and cheap, with no emotional weight felt. The biggest stunt was spoiled beforehand which I suppose did its job in getting me in the seat, but totally ruins the moment in film. The final act also lacked any tension and was honestly a little boring - there wasn't any real cleverness.Still, it was humorous throughout, had a good amount of charm and the production value is evident. That's enough for me to be above average but it's unlikely I'll watch the followup in theater.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: As a hardout Mission fan. I can confirm 5 years was definitely worth the wait. The film is extremally charming and filled with exciting humor, action and story-telling. Tom and Hayley really bring the film so much joy and create wonderful chemistry. The chase scene in Rome puts you on the edge of your seat and nothing prepares you for the daring things Tom and Hayley pull off in the train sequence.. Tom really understands the action genre and did not disappoint with this film. There is a perfect blend between foundation building for the story and the action sequences. The film is a beautiful set up to the part 2 coming next year.. Brilliant Watch 100/10.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Straight up Dead Reckoning Part 1 was fine. I think it's the weakest out of the last four instalments.I can't put my finger on one exact thing but it just felt a little underdone compared to the last few M:I and was expecting big things the whole movie. It was a combination of things like the acting felt a little weak I guess, the script was just fine, the action was decent but not great compared to other M:I and to the likes of John Wick that I'm now used to. The plot with the A. I is nothing new but it's always still interesting and especially at a time in the real world where the advancements seem to be heating up but the whole pickpocketing the key for 2 hours also got boring so fast. Too many cliches started piling up. The hand to hand combat was some of the weakest stuff I've seen it a while especially the Venice bridge scene, it looked awful, like I could see the choreography. The best scene for me was the desert storm at the start which really had my attention but everything after that seemed just average.I don't know if everyone else is now completely over their only trick being having someone go as someone else with these masks. It's so boring to me now and at a stage I'm kinda rolling my eyes. I really hope the machine blowing a fuse means we have seen the last of them.Tom Cruise is awesome with the stunts he does and will always have respect for the things him doing them but I really wish they didn't show the motorbike cliff jump scene in the trailer. What you see in the trailer is literally the whole stunt, don't get me wrong it's truly impressive but they showed the whole thing and just completely killed it for me.I'm slightly bummed with this one and just coming off seeing Indian Jones and having a lot more fun watching that. I don't care about runtimes but you have to have me sucked in and the whole time, I felt the time...People will love this movie but M:I may have fizzled out with me a bit after this one.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Greetings again from the darkness. The challenge in continuing the \"Mission: Impossible\" franchise is that fans expect each entry to be \"bigger\" and more awe-inspiring than the last. With the seventh film in the series, and the third straight he has directed, writer-director Christopher McQuarrie and superstar actor and daredevil Tom Cruise have managed to accomplish what seemed unlikely ... they have delivered Ethan Hunt's biggest and grandest mission yet. Prepare to be awed by the action.You should know that this is \"Part One\" and it runs 163 minutes, a full hour longer than most movies, and exponentially more expensive to produce. All this during an age when ultra-high-budget blockbusters are being rumored to be fading from public interest. Of course, we are only one year removed from Tom Cruise's TOP GUN: MAVERICK being credited with 'saving cinema', so stay on alert for a 'sky is falling' panic. McQuarrie co-wrote the script with Erik Jendresen (\"Band of Brothers\"), and they remain faithful to the characters and storylines established by the TV series creator, Bruce Geller.There may never have been an actor more suited to a recurring role than Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt (Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones might be the closest). The story itself is fairly straightforward, even if the item being chased often feels like a MacGuffin. Your questioning of how a 'simple' spy-thriller can be effective is understandable, yet it's fascinating to watch as Ethan Hunt's mission in life as an agent is evaluated, as is the cost he's paid as a man. Providing a contemporary theme, the obscure object of desire is an all-powerful key (actually two parts of a key) based on controlling an all-encompassing Artificial Intelligence (AI).In a twist on a familiar theme (and a classic comedy film), we have Airports, Trains, and EVs, the latter being a tiny Fiat with handcuffs. Still, the car chase is everything we might hope, while the high-tech facial search in the airport sequence delivers the thrills for techie viewers, and the train sparring occurs inside as well as on top. And lest you be worried, there are enough Cruise sprint scenes here to put CHARIOTS OF FIRE to shame.Familiar faces include Ethan Hunt's team of Luther (Ving Rhames, who along with Cruise, has appeared in all 7 MI films), Benji (Simon Pegg), and Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). It's nice to again see (and hear) Henry Czerny as Kittridge, Vanessa Kirby as arms dealer The White Widow, and Esai Morales - as Gabriel, the required villain in search of the same key as our good guys. New faces include Haylee Atwell as master pickpocket Grace, whose soul may or may not be beyond salvation; Cary Elwes as agency director Denlinger; Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis as officers after rogue Hunt; and Pom Klementieff as a hired assassin.The stunt work here is outstanding, and of course, Tom Cruise is renowned for personally handling many of the most breathtaking acts - the most memorable one here being his riding of a motorcycle off a cliff. This stunt has a 'making of' video that's been available for a while. As movie goers, we've never seen anything like it. This part one was originally scheduled for release in 2021 (thanks a lot, COVID), and now Part Two is set for 2024. It's been 27 years since the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE (1996) with Jon Voight ... Cruise was 34 in that one. This particular mission is the biggest yet, and it would certainly be impossible for the rest of us. It's a mission that will be closed out in Part Two, and simultaneously bring an end to Cruise's remarkable run as Ethan Hunt.Opening July 12, 2023.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: This movie started out promising but by the end, it just felt like being robbed of two and a half hours. I am a big fan of the MI movies (including MI2, which people seem to hate) and I could appreciate this movie for the few scenes that it did right, but it treats the audience like idiots in its bland, repetitive storyline (how many times do we need to hear the words \"the key\" and \"the entity\"? It was as if the writers of this movie just gave up on their jobs when they wrote this. Easily the weakest MI movie ever filmed. It had me staring at my watch every 20 minutes. As others have mentioned, the character development in this movie is also truly awful. I have barely any interest in seeing Part Two of Dead Reckoning at this point. The high scores this movie is getting absolutely baffle me. This movie by no means deserves a score higher than a 6 or a 6.5.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Basically, this movie is big, loud, and stupid.Definitely TOO loud, in fact. The music attempts to turn even the most minor scene into some sort of heart-pounding climax.There are endless ridiculous fights in which Tom Cruise is predictably unstoppable, no matter how many opponents he's up against. Slim girls get to beat up multiple men. (Emily Blunt was right when, commenting on a fight in \"Sicario\" in which, refreshingly, she loses to a bigger guy, she noted that Hollywood fight scenes in which 110-pound women whip larger males are \"so cheesy.\")The dull, tepid, way-too-pretty villain is, implausibly, a formidable fighter but sure doesn't look like one. An action movie is only as good as its villain is evil; this guy looks like a French fashion mogul.He and Cruise fight on top of -- wait for it -- a moving train! Haven't we seen that ridiculous sort of thing a hundred times before?The tediously overcomplicated plot makes it hard to keep track of who's on which side, nor do we care. Apparently, as is usual these days, we're supposed to root against the U. S. government.In all scenes involving conversations, virtually EVERY line is merely plot exposition in which characters tell us, in stilted dialogue, what's going on, what's supposed to happen, and how we're supposed to feel.The much-touted parachute jump is actually disappointing. It's over quite fast, and its main source of interest is that, if you've seen the promotional video, you know that Cruise himself actually made that jump.The only truly enjoyable sequence -- the cleverly worked-out rescue attempts on the falling train -- comes at the end, after nearly two and a half hours of empty cartoonish nonsense...Including, of course, an overlong cartoonish car chase, obligatory in dumb summer movies.\n",

It feels huge the whole time however I must say I while the set pieces were stellar, the hand to hand combat scenes were not great and a big step down from the last film (Fallout).Thebeginning is slow with a lot of expository being dumped (more than you'd usually see) but once it gets going it is pretty nonstop.This is a good chapter and Haley Atwell shines but it is nowhere near my favorite of the series.7/10Mi rankingsMi6 Fallout\n",

            "Skipping non-numeric rating: 'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part I (M:I7) is another strong entry in the action/spy series, with Ethan (Cruise) looking slightly older, but not less determined to save the world. I believe the sequel to this film will be his last outing - but we'll see. This time, there's some Skynet-like sentient-AI that's manipulating nefarious types to take over the world, so the IMF team are out to get the two halves of key that can stop it.Isla (Ferguson), Benji (Pegg) and Luther (Rhames) are back, as well as CIA boss Kittridge (Czerny), with Grace (Atwell), a thief, being the newcomer. The bad guys that keep thwarting them are Gabriel (Morales) from Ethan's past, and Paris (Klementieff). The consistency of having McQuarrie as director of the two previous films helps, with everything feeling assured and this working as a really solid follow-up to 'Fallout'.There's some funny moments, some sincere ones, and some of Ethan running, as contractually-obliged. The whole final scene on the train is excellent, with so many things happening, but there's plenty of good set-pieces throughout, including a good car chase. However, the piece-de-resistance is the motorbike off the cliff into a BASE jump is something else. The fact Cruise did it for real, multiple times, is crazy and inspiring.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Man.... I wish I loved this movie more than I did. Don't get me wrong, it's a solid action movie with jaw-dropping stunts (some of the best in the series), but as a Mission: Impossible movie, it felt like a small step backward for the franchise. Fallout had mind-blowing action sequences and stunt work, along with developing Ethan's relationship with Ilsa, providing closure with Julia, showing the lengths Ethan would go to protect those closest to him, and battling an imposing villain. Dead Reckoning: Part One stretches the movie across two films only to seemingly showcase action spectacle after action spectacle while sacrificing character development. Characters I have grown to love over a decade of films felt sidelined, ignored, or wasted. Hayley Atwell's new character chewed up most of the screen time, and while she was fantastic, I wanted to see more of the original team. The new villain had an inconsistent ability that confused more than intimidated. There were some important emotional moments that I just didn't feel the weight of when I definitely should have. Part Two might tie everything together and make me enjoy Part One more in retrospect, but unfortunately, I left wanting more from this one.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Just got out of seeing this movie. I am really disappointed that they totally killed off the potential relationship between Ethan and Ilsa. I am totally OK with her dying but the way that they did it and how anti-climactic it was after building up her character so much in the previous two films. Just seems like she would've deserved a better death than that. Also, what was the point of showing the two characters getting closer to each other, and in the last film, his ex-wife, basically giving them permission to move forward when you're just going to kill her off like that. Honestly, Rebecca Ferguson revised this franchise two movies ago and I think killing off her character was a big mistake. Even in the scenes that she's in it doesn't even seem like she's playing the same person. I wonder if they wrote her out of the movie because she's too busy with the rest of her work. Hayley Atwell's character doesn't make sense to me either. Just put her in the IMF because she can pick some pockets? This all seems forced. Maybe most won't agree, but I think this development totally ruined the movie for me.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Just saw this one in a theatre, and boy... what an adrenaline rush it is. The latest Mission Impossible features some of the most incredible stunts ever put to camera. The story is absolutely exhilarating and continues to bring new life to a veteran movie franchise. The sheer scale of this movie is epic, and with every twist and turn of the movie, you cannot help but marvel at the incredible sets used to bring this movie to life. Such a movie begs to be seen on the biggest screen possible where you can truly feel the grandeur of the film. Tom Cruise has once again delivered one of the best movies of the year, and I cannot recommend that you see it enough!\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: To me, a new M:I film is an event. From Part 4 onwards, they've been spectacular (all 10/10's).There's some good stuff here for sure, and overall it's a solid 8, but it's simply not as good as previous entries.I kept noticing that a lot of scenes had just 2 or 3 people in them, and I kept imagining the crew all masked up, as well as the cast when the camera wasn't on them. It can't be easy to make a huge movie like this during a pandemic, but it definitely shows.The A. I. plot is quite good, and Hunt's as-yet-unknown backstory quite intriguing, but the whole story basically revolves around: \"I've got the key, now she's got the key, now he's got the key\" etc. So much pick-pocketing.Also, I really wish they hadn't ruined the motorcycle jump in the promos. If you've seen the promo, you've seen the scene. There are really only 3 or 4 action sequences, and nothing we haven't really seen before. I actually enjoyed the first desert shoot-out the best.And- oh!- the exposition! There's a scene near the beginning that reminded me of a Neil Breen(!) movie, where powerful people sit in a room and just spout buzz words like \"nuclear war,\" \"economic collapse,\" \"dogs and cats living together\" etc.THAT said, it's still an 8/10. Tom always gives it his best, the rest of the cast is good (especially all four female leads) and I thought the added humour with Hunt's character was a nice touch. I'd rather watch this ten times over than any blatant cyncial Disney cash-grab.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Good God. I feel ashamed for approaching this film with a modicum of doubt that Tom would still be able to deliver. Unbelievably, this epic actually manages to top the brilliant Fallout. Tom is literally going to die if he keeps doing these stunts. The motorbike sequence is utterly ludicrous. Intriguing plot with actual stakes and some familiar faces ably supported by brilliant new allies and villains. Sets up Part II perfectly with a sensational finale that homages Back to the Future 3, MI:1 and Speed. It is funny, action packed, polished and exhilarating. Harrison was great last week, but Tom is still the King. 9/10.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: I was lucky to be able to watch this 4 days before its official release in Czech Republic as a pre-premiere (didn't know such a thing existed) and it was the first time I've felt real excitement to go watch a film at the cinema in ages thanks to the recent genius combination of Fallout and Top Gun 2.I know what they were trying to do with this film. Bringing Kittridge back and a convoluted train finale all harked back to the 1st movie that sparked it all off. Explaining that convoluted storyline along the way harks back to the criticisms made about that same first film.The sky jump stunt was an attempt to beat the stunts from Tom Cruise in previous installments that have now become a beloved trademark of the franchise.But this film unfortunately overall is most reminiscent of the second installment which was Tom Cruise centric and lacked any real impossible mission requiring teamwork, real stakes and ingenious problem solving.In fact, it could have even been intentional that this film reminds the viewer of Mission Impossible 2. The photos in the film of past Ethan Hunt when searching for present Ethan Hunt show him with his longer hair as he looked in that second film.Ultimately, I expected the story to be way better than what we get in this instalment.There are 2 guys that keep appearing at each scene trying to catch Ethan which seems a very cheap simple story.And the very simple plot is explained in long scenes to make it seem way more complicated that it actually is (people complained there should be more explanation in the first film, but at least the plot in the first film actually required brain power), and I have to say that some of the acting is quite poor at times, not helped by some rather cheesy lines in the script, including the lines and accents in the opening Russian submarine sequence.There is also not that much action. 3 main action sequences for a close to 3 hour movie, which are the desert shoot out at the beginning, the Venice car chase, and the train crash at the end.I thought the alleyway fight scene, which some have praised, was really quite subpar and not very enthralling.The best action scene is the Venice car chase because it is genuinely funny (yes, because it is excellently laugh out loud funny, but not in any way tense); I never had the feeling that I was on the edge of my seat.The motorcycle sky jump scene was a major disappointment after the hype because if you didn't know Cruise actually did do that stunt, they used so much CGI that people would just assume it was computer generated. It actually reminded me of Pierce Brosnan's riding the tsunami in Die Another Day (sorry Tom! The stunt is still awesome!).The same for the train at the end. I know they actually made that train, and probably actually threw it off a bridge, but it doesn't look real. Though it is a long action finale and very fun to watch, for me the lack of realism takes away any tension. You are enjoying it for its visual value, but again not feeling any 'wow' factor or tension.At the end of Fallout, for example, you really felt Ethan Hunt was battered, bruised, worn out and still fighting to save humanity. There is none of that.The most tragic thing about this movie is that, unlike in the best of the previous films, we're back to the team being irrelevant in this one. Benji and Luther don't actually do very much.And poor Ilsa. Fallout ended with Ethan's ex-wife essentially giving him permission to move on and be with Ilsa.The relationship between Ilsa and Hunt had been built up over two excellent movies - Rogue Nation and Fallout - and in this film she says almost nothing, looks grumpy and sad all the time, and dies in an anticlimactic fight that is literally spelt out to the audience as a way to replace her with newcomer Grace.Grace, played by Hayley Atwell, is good. A likeable character and a capable actress, but I don't get the story unless Rebecca Ferguson said she wants out the franchise.The film is all about chasing \"the key.\" No twists. No high stakes. There is virtually no grittiness in this outing. It feels very light.Ultimately I was hoping to enjoy a quality film in the franchise. A movie like Oblivion, Edge of Tomorrow, Fallout, Top Gun 2 or American Made that you can show to anyone and say these are recent really high quality films starring this guy called Tom Cruise.This is not one of those films.It is more like The Mummy. It is better than Mission Impossible 2 but not better than any of the others in the franchise.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One confirms that Mission Impossible is the best franchise currently going and possibly ever made. A 2 hour 43 minute adrenaline rush that contains some of the best action sequences put to film, embarrasses the majority of the competition out there and sets the stage for a magnificent part 2 whilst still being a satisfying adventure in its own right.This is possibly the most open and obvious a Mission film has been with its deeper meaning for cinema and what aspect of Cruise's career is being dissected this time with a film that focuses on Ethan's relationship with women and basically outright declares AI to be a soulless monster and how the human element is always needed (perfect film to release during a writer's strike).Tom Cruise is perfect as Ethan Hunt and the strongest aspect this time round is when the film explores what made Ethan who he is and reminds you he genuinely cares about his team but that comes at a cost. Physically, the madman is still going strong with his stunts, driving a bike off a cliff in truly breathtaking fashion.Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg and Rebecca Ferguson remain the best IMF team and all play to their strengths here. The longer this series goes on the more authentic their growing friendship feels. Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis get more than expected and their buddy cop antics are a lot of fun.With Esai Morales' charismatic yet terrifying Gabriel and Pom Klementieff's terrific henchman of few words, this franchise finally has more good villains than bad. The return of Henry Czerny as Kittridge is glorious and he remains as gleefully despicable as his first appearance.The best new addition is easily Hayley Atwell. She plays a type of character never seen before in these films which makes her character and dynamic with Cruise fresh in comparison to everyone who's come before and their chemistry is magnetic. Instantaneous from the second they interact.Christopher McQuarrie's direction is phenomenal. The action sequences are suitably practical (this is how you spend $290 million), and the camera gets as close to the action as humanly possible, he remains one of the best in the business working at this scale. There's plenty of canted angles as a nice homage to De Palma's original and it helps give this one its own style in comparison to McQuarrie's previous entries.The pacing is really impressive with the film feeling like it's in a perpetual third act from its first airport heist (which is so much fun). Lorne Balfe does the music once again and yet again it's a highlight of the film, he knows how to elevate everything so well and really hammers home the emotional beats.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Ethan Hunt has left the mere secret agent status and has ascended to the all living perfect messiah.There is so much wrong with this movie, which seriously pains me because I seriously love this series. The mission impossible movies have steadily become more convoluted and more stupidly written. This film reaches the peak of absurdity, feeling more like an over the top fast and furious movie. All foolish action, cheap parlor tricks to pull the heart strings (empty relationships), horrible writing, poor plot development.I mean seriously what ever happened to show don't tell?! This is becoming rather ridiculous.*convoluted villain dialogue*\n",

Tom Cruise delivers on some awesome stunts (seldom compared to other MI films). It's not horrible. It's fun entertainment, but a scour on the (in my opinion) reputable authentic feeling mission impossible series.\n",

Tom Cruise did it again, WOW!! It's an exhausting ride he takes you on, man I forgot to eat my popcorn and by the time i finally wanted some my wife had eaten all of it, but hey I was so immersed into the movie that time stood still and i forgot everything around me.Go and see it, this one gets my full recommendation, the only reason it's not a 10 is due to the fact it's not a completely new type of movie, however this one is done as a good action movie should be made, i don't see how they could have made it better, I really can't, go watch it and have a good time while you do it, it will put a big smile on your face that's for sure.\n",

Thus I am quite disappointed on how this mission never seemed too difficult , let alone impossible.Action was okay. Car chase was funny, but not exciting. Jumping off the cliff seemed forced to me. Why would you keep driving uphill when you can take short cuts to reach the train. It wasn't even a fast train. The key kept being stolen from pockets too many times which makes you wonder how lazy the scripting was. Kill old gf to make new gf was also lazy writing.Unlike other MIs, Ethan had no single smart move or plan. It felt more like let's go and see what happens.Am not sure how MI fans ignored all these weaknesses and gave this film 8+ rating.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: This was a great movie. However, it lost a star from me for making the audience believe Ilsa is dead. They've spent two films building up Ilsa as being Ethan's equal, and hinted at an eventual romance. She's been able to fight off multiple men bare-handed yet she meets her demise by one guy when she has a sword? Then they brush past her death like it means nothing, only for her to be replaced by a new woman. I thought it was a huge disservice to the character.I know Rebecca Ferguson is very busy so she might have asked to leave, but I'm hoping this isn't the end for my favorite character in these films. She deserves a happy ending, or at least a better death than the one she received in this movie. It really took me out of the rest of the film. Hopefully, we'll see her again in Part Two.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Remember that classic MI scene where they broke in at CIA, and Cruise was hanging from the ceiling using wires? It's not a huge setpiece, but that scene is a nailbiting example of ingenious problem solving.In 'Dead Reckoning' there's none of that. Here it's keys changing hands every 10 minutes that is suppose to pass as suspense. And of course the only true selling point: the stunts performed by Tom Cruise.But I want and expect more than that.A large part of the film is devoted to people sitting or standing in a room, explaining what the plot is. Endless talking and explaining. We are told in several scenes the same information we just heard. Worst one is Benji, who is merely there to repeat things for someone in the cast, to make sure everyone in the audience knows what is going on. That is sloppy writing. One of the biggest no-no's as a screenwriter is resolving to \"so what you are saying is, that...\" info sharing. Benji does this all the time. And he is as incompetent as usual. And he is supposed to be a part of a small and unique team that is saving the world? Really?I hope MI:8 isn't just another Tom Cruise stunt reel where it looks like they make the story up as the go along, as long as all marks are checked in the end (running, face swapping, dealing with heights etc), and where character development takes a backseat. Bigger is not always better. And the action ALWAYS has to serve the story, not the other way around.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: After the first 30 minutes that promised an intellectual action thriller, the film starts its nosedive into mediocrity by introducing a thief who constantly indulges in disloyalty, for petty gains, towards the IMF and Hunt, but is held in high regards by Hunt. For the life of me, I couldn't understand why. The film also doesn't bother with it.Neither is it concerned with the so called action set pieces. _Fallout_ had plethora of those, one after the other, tied together by a cogent story line. For all its hype, it has 2-3 in a run time of close to 160 minutes, which tested my patience.Reading it's critics' reviews post viewing make me feel as if they have been written by the Entity, the AI behemoth at the center of this. The perceived entertainment value implied by them is not even remotely connected with the reality.It is no wonder that it is faltering at the US box office. It is no Top Gun- Maverick. Crowds are going to turn up, especially outside the US, because of Cruise's star power. But I don't believe this will please most of them.Disappointing.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: An absolute masterclass in producing an enjoyable action movie. Cinematography was great, the story was paced extremely well, and the casting of ALL roles was absolutely perfect.Cruise, Pegg and Rhames were awesome as always, Whigham and Davis were great additions, but the power quartet of Ferguson, Atwell, Klementieff and Kirby, really went above and beyond in making this movie perfect. Not to mention the chilling confidence of Morales as Gabriel, who practically oozes tangible danger.From the pre-opening credits scene to the final act, if you're like me, you will be on the edge of your seat - especially during any fight scene that involves Ferguson or Klementieff - and whilst there are moments that the tempo slows down to advance the story, it is always completely captivating.The single, solitary, disappointment comes as the credits roll, and you remember you're going to have to wait until next year to see how it ends.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Absolutely superb! Was hoping they could do the impossible and surpass Fallout! And Cruise, McQuarrie and co have accomplished this in spades, delivering the best spy/ action thriller in years.It is a next level masterclass of a film, with everything you would expect from an Mission Impossible film and more.The cast are great, with the new additions adding so much to the usual MI crew. The stunts are performed to the usual high standard and give you that Wow feeling you want, The story is fantastic, leaving you wanting more, setting up Part Two really wellGo see this on the best screen possible.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: It should be impossible to fumble the bag so badly on a nostalgia trip movie like this. Just let Tom Cruise run, do some crazy stunts and play the iconic theme music. But no they gotta drag on for three hours with a meaningless storyline just for it to be one part of an incomplete movie. Like whatever happened to movie editing? There's no reason for this movie to be this long and a lot of the content is completely unnecessary to move the plot forward. I don't expect MI movies to have watertight logic but then atleast the writers shouldn't twist themselves into knots thinking they're making a deeper movie than they are, the sooner these movie trends with AI, quantum space tunneling, multiverse nonsense end the better it is for good storylines.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: This latest Mission: Impossible movie is a slam dunk that needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible. Tom Cruise certainly knows how to make a movie. In another universe Cruse could have been Iron Man and I always felt that his aggression with the Mission: Impossible franchise was his way of making up for that. That's probably why the dialog in this movie felt like Ethan Hawk was captain America or something and they are going up against a Bonafede supervillain in the form of an A. I system. As far as I'm concern the best villain of the franchise snice the late and great Phillip Seymour Huffman.The Avengers Assemble as franchise regulars Simon Pegg as Dunn and Ving Rhimes, who I say with glee, started this franchise with Cruse as Luther, make their return as IMF agents. Rebecca Ferguson reprises her role from the last movie and Haley Atwell is in the movie as well, but none of this makes me as happy as Ving still being in the franchise.The action sequences are so good in this picture. It was worth having to stay in me seat for almost three hours just so they can add a little more action in-between the Hero's journey dialogue.And this is just part one!? Part two has some big shoes to fill!\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: I love Tom Cruise movies, but this one feels pretty contrived. Beyond the plot, Grace was the biggest detriment to the movie. The character started out amusing but her shtick became insufferable and Ethan's infatuation idiotic. How they handled Ilsa feels both rushed and cheap, with no emotional weight felt. The biggest stunt was spoiled beforehand which I suppose did its job in getting me in the seat, but totally ruins the moment in film. The final act also lacked any tension and was honestly a little boring - there wasn't any real cleverness.Still, it was humorous throughout, had a good amount of charm and the production value is evident. That's enough for me to be above average but it's unlikely I'll watch the followup in theater.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: As a hardout Mission fan. I can confirm 5 years was definitely worth the wait. The film is extremally charming and filled with exciting humor, action and story-telling. Tom and Hayley really bring the film so much joy and create wonderful chemistry. The chase scene in Rome puts you on the edge of your seat and nothing prepares you for the daring things Tom and Hayley pull off in the train sequence.. Tom really understands the action genre and did not disappoint with this film. There is a perfect blend between foundation building for the story and the action sequences. The film is a beautiful set up to the part 2 coming next year.. Brilliant Watch 100/10.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Straight up Dead Reckoning Part 1 was fine. I think it's the weakest out of the last four instalments.I can't put my finger on one exact thing but it just felt a little underdone compared to the last few M:I and was expecting big things the whole movie. It was a combination of things like the acting felt a little weak I guess, the script was just fine, the action was decent but not great compared to other M:I and to the likes of John Wick that I'm now used to. The plot with the A. I is nothing new but it's always still interesting and especially at a time in the real world where the advancements seem to be heating up but the whole pickpocketing the key for 2 hours also got boring so fast. Too many cliches started piling up. The hand to hand combat was some of the weakest stuff I've seen it a while especially the Venice bridge scene, it looked awful, like I could see the choreography. The best scene for me was the desert storm at the start which really had my attention but everything after that seemed just average.I don't know if everyone else is now completely over their only trick being having someone go as someone else with these masks. It's so boring to me now and at a stage I'm kinda rolling my eyes. I really hope the machine blowing a fuse means we have seen the last of them.Tom Cruise is awesome with the stunts he does and will always have respect for the things him doing them but I really wish they didn't show the motorbike cliff jump scene in the trailer. What you see in the trailer is literally the whole stunt, don't get me wrong it's truly impressive but they showed the whole thing and just completely killed it for me.I'm slightly bummed with this one and just coming off seeing Indian Jones and having a lot more fun watching that. I don't care about runtimes but you have to have me sucked in and the whole time, I felt the time...People will love this movie but M:I may have fizzled out with me a bit after this one.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Greetings again from the darkness. The challenge in continuing the \"Mission: Impossible\" franchise is that fans expect each entry to be \"bigger\" and more awe-inspiring than the last. With the seventh film in the series, and the third straight he has directed, writer-director Christopher McQuarrie and superstar actor and daredevil Tom Cruise have managed to accomplish what seemed unlikely ... they have delivered Ethan Hunt's biggest and grandest mission yet. Prepare to be awed by the action.You should know that this is \"Part One\" and it runs 163 minutes, a full hour longer than most movies, and exponentially more expensive to produce. All this during an age when ultra-high-budget blockbusters are being rumored to be fading from public interest. Of course, we are only one year removed from Tom Cruise's TOP GUN: MAVERICK being credited with 'saving cinema', so stay on alert for a 'sky is falling' panic. McQuarrie co-wrote the script with Erik Jendresen (\"Band of Brothers\"), and they remain faithful to the characters and storylines established by the TV series creator, Bruce Geller.There may never have been an actor more suited to a recurring role than Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt (Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones might be the closest). The story itself is fairly straightforward, even if the item being chased often feels like a MacGuffin. Your questioning of how a 'simple' spy-thriller can be effective is understandable, yet it's fascinating to watch as Ethan Hunt's mission in life as an agent is evaluated, as is the cost he's paid as a man. Providing a contemporary theme, the obscure object of desire is an all-powerful key (actually two parts of a key) based on controlling an all-encompassing Artificial Intelligence (AI).In a twist on a familiar theme (and a classic comedy film), we have Airports, Trains, and EVs, the latter being a tiny Fiat with handcuffs. Still, the car chase is everything we might hope, while the high-tech facial search in the airport sequence delivers the thrills for techie viewers, and the train sparring occurs inside as well as on top. And lest you be worried, there are enough Cruise sprint scenes here to put CHARIOTS OF FIRE to shame.Familiar faces include Ethan Hunt's team of Luther (Ving Rhames, who along with Cruise, has appeared in all 7 MI films), Benji (Simon Pegg), and Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). It's nice to again see (and hear) Henry Czerny as Kittridge, Vanessa Kirby as arms dealer The White Widow, and Esai Morales - as Gabriel, the required villain in search of the same key as our good guys. New faces include Haylee Atwell as master pickpocket Grace, whose soul may or may not be beyond salvation; Cary Elwes as agency director Denlinger; Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis as officers after rogue Hunt; and Pom Klementieff as a hired assassin.The stunt work here is outstanding, and of course, Tom Cruise is renowned for personally handling many of the most breathtaking acts - the most memorable one here being his riding of a motorcycle off a cliff. This stunt has a 'making of' video that's been available for a while. As movie goers, we've never seen anything like it. This part one was originally scheduled for release in 2021 (thanks a lot, COVID), and now Part Two is set for 2024. It's been 27 years since the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE (1996) with Jon Voight ... Cruise was 34 in that one. This particular mission is the biggest yet, and it would certainly be impossible for the rest of us. It's a mission that will be closed out in Part Two, and simultaneously bring an end to Cruise's remarkable run as Ethan Hunt.Opening July 12, 2023.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: This movie started out promising but by the end, it just felt like being robbed of two and a half hours. I am a big fan of the MI movies (including MI2, which people seem to hate) and I could appreciate this movie for the few scenes that it did right, but it treats the audience like idiots in its bland, repetitive storyline (how many times do we need to hear the words \"the key\" and \"the entity\"? It was as if the writers of this movie just gave up on their jobs when they wrote this. Easily the weakest MI movie ever filmed. It had me staring at my watch every 20 minutes. As others have mentioned, the character development in this movie is also truly awful. I have barely any interest in seeing Part Two of Dead Reckoning at this point. The high scores this movie is getting absolutely baffle me. This movie by no means deserves a score higher than a 6 or a 6.5.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Basically, this movie is big, loud, and stupid.Definitely TOO loud, in fact. The music attempts to turn even the most minor scene into some sort of heart-pounding climax.There are endless ridiculous fights in which Tom Cruise is predictably unstoppable, no matter how many opponents he's up against. Slim girls get to beat up multiple men. (Emily Blunt was right when, commenting on a fight in \"Sicario\" in which, refreshingly, she loses to a bigger guy, she noted that Hollywood fight scenes in which 110-pound women whip larger males are \"so cheesy.\")The dull, tepid, way-too-pretty villain is, implausibly, a formidable fighter but sure doesn't look like one. An action movie is only as good as its villain is evil; this guy looks like a French fashion mogul.He and Cruise fight on top of -- wait for it -- a moving train! Haven't we seen that ridiculous sort of thing a hundred times before?The tediously overcomplicated plot makes it hard to keep track of who's on which side, nor do we care. Apparently, as is usual these days, we're supposed to root against the U. S. government.In all scenes involving conversations, virtually EVERY line is merely plot exposition in which characters tell us, in stilted dialogue, what's going on, what's supposed to happen, and how we're supposed to feel.The much-touted parachute jump is actually disappointing. It's over quite fast, and its main source of interest is that, if you've seen the promotional video, you know that Cruise himself actually made that jump.The only truly enjoyable sequence -- the cleverly worked-out rescue attempts on the falling train -- comes at the end, after nearly two and a half hours of empty cartoonish nonsense...Including, of course, an overlong cartoonish car chase, obligatory in dumb summer movies.\n",

It feels huge the whole time however I must say I while the set pieces were stellar, the hand to hand combat scenes were not great and a big step down from the last film (Fallout).Thebeginning is slow with a lot of expository being dumped (more than you'd usually see) but once it gets going it is pretty nonstop.This is a good chapter and Haley Atwell shines but it is nowhere near my favorite of the series.7/10Mi rankingsMi6 Fallout\n",

            "Skipping non-numeric rating: 'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part I (M:I7) is another strong entry in the action/spy series, with Ethan (Cruise) looking slightly older, but not less determined to save the world. I believe the sequel to this film will be his last outing - but we'll see. This time, there's some Skynet-like sentient-AI that's manipulating nefarious types to take over the world, so the IMF team are out to get the two halves of key that can stop it.Isla (Ferguson), Benji (Pegg) and Luther (Rhames) are back, as well as CIA boss Kittridge (Czerny), with Grace (Atwell), a thief, being the newcomer. The bad guys that keep thwarting them are Gabriel (Morales) from Ethan's past, and Paris (Klementieff). The consistency of having McQuarrie as director of the two previous films helps, with everything feeling assured and this working as a really solid follow-up to 'Fallout'.There's some funny moments, some sincere ones, and some of Ethan running, as contractually-obliged. The whole final scene on the train is excellent, with so many things happening, but there's plenty of good set-pieces throughout, including a good car chase. However, the piece-de-resistance is the motorbike off the cliff into a BASE jump is something else. The fact Cruise did it for real, multiple times, is crazy and inspiring.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Man.... I wish I loved this movie more than I did. Don't get me wrong, it's a solid action movie with jaw-dropping stunts (some of the best in the series), but as a Mission: Impossible movie, it felt like a small step backward for the franchise. Fallout had mind-blowing action sequences and stunt work, along with developing Ethan's relationship with Ilsa, providing closure with Julia, showing the lengths Ethan would go to protect those closest to him, and battling an imposing villain. Dead Reckoning: Part One stretches the movie across two films only to seemingly showcase action spectacle after action spectacle while sacrificing character development. Characters I have grown to love over a decade of films felt sidelined, ignored, or wasted. Hayley Atwell's new character chewed up most of the screen time, and while she was fantastic, I wanted to see more of the original team. The new villain had an inconsistent ability that confused more than intimidated. There were some important emotional moments that I just didn't feel the weight of when I definitely should have. Part Two might tie everything together and make me enjoy Part One more in retrospect, but unfortunately, I left wanting more from this one.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Just got out of seeing this movie. I am really disappointed that they totally killed off the potential relationship between Ethan and Ilsa. I am totally OK with her dying but the way that they did it and how anti-climactic it was after building up her character so much in the previous two films. Just seems like she would've deserved a better death than that. Also, what was the point of showing the two characters getting closer to each other, and in the last film, his ex-wife, basically giving them permission to move forward when you're just going to kill her off like that. Honestly, Rebecca Ferguson revised this franchise two movies ago and I think killing off her character was a big mistake. Even in the scenes that she's in it doesn't even seem like she's playing the same person. I wonder if they wrote her out of the movie because she's too busy with the rest of her work. Hayley Atwell's character doesn't make sense to me either. Just put her in the IMF because she can pick some pockets? This all seems forced. Maybe most won't agree, but I think this development totally ruined the movie for me.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Just saw this one in a theatre, and boy... what an adrenaline rush it is. The latest Mission Impossible features some of the most incredible stunts ever put to camera. The story is absolutely exhilarating and continues to bring new life to a veteran movie franchise. The sheer scale of this movie is epic, and with every twist and turn of the movie, you cannot help but marvel at the incredible sets used to bring this movie to life. Such a movie begs to be seen on the biggest screen possible where you can truly feel the grandeur of the film. Tom Cruise has once again delivered one of the best movies of the year, and I cannot recommend that you see it enough!\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: To me, a new M:I film is an event. From Part 4 onwards, they've been spectacular (all 10/10's).There's some good stuff here for sure, and overall it's a solid 8, but it's simply not as good as previous entries.I kept noticing that a lot of scenes had just 2 or 3 people in them, and I kept imagining the crew all masked up, as well as the cast when the camera wasn't on them. It can't be easy to make a huge movie like this during a pandemic, but it definitely shows.The A. I. plot is quite good, and Hunt's as-yet-unknown backstory quite intriguing, but the whole story basically revolves around: \"I've got the key, now she's got the key, now he's got the key\" etc. So much pick-pocketing.Also, I really wish they hadn't ruined the motorcycle jump in the promos. If you've seen the promo, you've seen the scene. There are really only 3 or 4 action sequences, and nothing we haven't really seen before. I actually enjoyed the first desert shoot-out the best.And- oh!- the exposition! There's a scene near the beginning that reminded me of a Neil Breen(!) movie, where powerful people sit in a room and just spout buzz words like \"nuclear war,\" \"economic collapse,\" \"dogs and cats living together\" etc.THAT said, it's still an 8/10. Tom always gives it his best, the rest of the cast is good (especially all four female leads) and I thought the added humour with Hunt's character was a nice touch. I'd rather watch this ten times over than any blatant cyncial Disney cash-grab.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Good God. I feel ashamed for approaching this film with a modicum of doubt that Tom would still be able to deliver. Unbelievably, this epic actually manages to top the brilliant Fallout. Tom is literally going to die if he keeps doing these stunts. The motorbike sequence is utterly ludicrous. Intriguing plot with actual stakes and some familiar faces ably supported by brilliant new allies and villains. Sets up Part II perfectly with a sensational finale that homages Back to the Future 3, MI:1 and Speed. It is funny, action packed, polished and exhilarating. Harrison was great last week, but Tom is still the King. 9/10.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: I was lucky to be able to watch this 4 days before its official release in Czech Republic as a pre-premiere (didn't know such a thing existed) and it was the first time I've felt real excitement to go watch a film at the cinema in ages thanks to the recent genius combination of Fallout and Top Gun 2.I know what they were trying to do with this film. Bringing Kittridge back and a convoluted train finale all harked back to the 1st movie that sparked it all off. Explaining that convoluted storyline along the way harks back to the criticisms made about that same first film.The sky jump stunt was an attempt to beat the stunts from Tom Cruise in previous installments that have now become a beloved trademark of the franchise.But this film unfortunately overall is most reminiscent of the second installment which was Tom Cruise centric and lacked any real impossible mission requiring teamwork, real stakes and ingenious problem solving.In fact, it could have even been intentional that this film reminds the viewer of Mission Impossible 2. The photos in the film of past Ethan Hunt when searching for present Ethan Hunt show him with his longer hair as he looked in that second film.Ultimately, I expected the story to be way better than what we get in this instalment.There are 2 guys that keep appearing at each scene trying to catch Ethan which seems a very cheap simple story.And the very simple plot is explained in long scenes to make it seem way more complicated that it actually is (people complained there should be more explanation in the first film, but at least the plot in the first film actually required brain power), and I have to say that some of the acting is quite poor at times, not helped by some rather cheesy lines in the script, including the lines and accents in the opening Russian submarine sequence.There is also not that much action. 3 main action sequences for a close to 3 hour movie, which are the desert shoot out at the beginning, the Venice car chase, and the train crash at the end.I thought the alleyway fight scene, which some have praised, was really quite subpar and not very enthralling.The best action scene is the Venice car chase because it is genuinely funny (yes, because it is excellently laugh out loud funny, but not in any way tense); I never had the feeling that I was on the edge of my seat.The motorcycle sky jump scene was a major disappointment after the hype because if you didn't know Cruise actually did do that stunt, they used so much CGI that people would just assume it was computer generated. It actually reminded me of Pierce Brosnan's riding the tsunami in Die Another Day (sorry Tom! The stunt is still awesome!).The same for the train at the end. I know they actually made that train, and probably actually threw it off a bridge, but it doesn't look real. Though it is a long action finale and very fun to watch, for me the lack of realism takes away any tension. You are enjoying it for its visual value, but again not feeling any 'wow' factor or tension.At the end of Fallout, for example, you really felt Ethan Hunt was battered, bruised, worn out and still fighting to save humanity. There is none of that.The most tragic thing about this movie is that, unlike in the best of the previous films, we're back to the team being irrelevant in this one. Benji and Luther don't actually do very much.And poor Ilsa. Fallout ended with Ethan's ex-wife essentially giving him permission to move on and be with Ilsa.The relationship between Ilsa and Hunt had been built up over two excellent movies - Rogue Nation and Fallout - and in this film she says almost nothing, looks grumpy and sad all the time, and dies in an anticlimactic fight that is literally spelt out to the audience as a way to replace her with newcomer Grace.Grace, played by Hayley Atwell, is good. A likeable character and a capable actress, but I don't get the story unless Rebecca Ferguson said she wants out the franchise.The film is all about chasing \"the key.\" No twists. No high stakes. There is virtually no grittiness in this outing. It feels very light.Ultimately I was hoping to enjoy a quality film in the franchise. A movie like Oblivion, Edge of Tomorrow, Fallout, Top Gun 2 or American Made that you can show to anyone and say these are recent really high quality films starring this guy called Tom Cruise.This is not one of those films.It is more like The Mummy. It is better than Mission Impossible 2 but not better than any of the others in the franchise.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One confirms that Mission Impossible is the best franchise currently going and possibly ever made. A 2 hour 43 minute adrenaline rush that contains some of the best action sequences put to film, embarrasses the majority of the competition out there and sets the stage for a magnificent part 2 whilst still being a satisfying adventure in its own right.This is possibly the most open and obvious a Mission film has been with its deeper meaning for cinema and what aspect of Cruise's career is being dissected this time with a film that focuses on Ethan's relationship with women and basically outright declares AI to be a soulless monster and how the human element is always needed (perfect film to release during a writer's strike).Tom Cruise is perfect as Ethan Hunt and the strongest aspect this time round is when the film explores what made Ethan who he is and reminds you he genuinely cares about his team but that comes at a cost. Physically, the madman is still going strong with his stunts, driving a bike off a cliff in truly breathtaking fashion.Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg and Rebecca Ferguson remain the best IMF team and all play to their strengths here. The longer this series goes on the more authentic their growing friendship feels. Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis get more than expected and their buddy cop antics are a lot of fun.With Esai Morales' charismatic yet terrifying Gabriel and Pom Klementieff's terrific henchman of few words, this franchise finally has more good villains than bad. The return of Henry Czerny as Kittridge is glorious and he remains as gleefully despicable as his first appearance.The best new addition is easily Hayley Atwell. She plays a type of character never seen before in these films which makes her character and dynamic with Cruise fresh in comparison to everyone who's come before and their chemistry is magnetic. Instantaneous from the second they interact.Christopher McQuarrie's direction is phenomenal. The action sequences are suitably practical (this is how you spend $290 million), and the camera gets as close to the action as humanly possible, he remains one of the best in the business working at this scale. There's plenty of canted angles as a nice homage to De Palma's original and it helps give this one its own style in comparison to McQuarrie's previous entries.The pacing is really impressive with the film feeling like it's in a perpetual third act from its first airport heist (which is so much fun). Lorne Balfe does the music once again and yet again it's a highlight of the film, he knows how to elevate everything so well and really hammers home the emotional beats.\n",

The mission impossible movies have steadily become more convoluted and more stupidly written. This film reaches the peak of absurdity, feeling more like an over the top fast and furious movie. All foolish action, cheap parlor tricks to pull the heart strings (empty relationships), horrible writing, poor plot development.I mean seriously what ever happened to show don't tell?! This is becoming rather ridiculous.*convoluted villain dialogue*\n",

Tom Cruise delivers on some awesome stunts (seldom compared to other MI films). It's not horrible. It's fun entertainment, but a scour on the (in my opinion) reputable authentic feeling mission impossible series.\n",

Tom Cruise did it again, WOW!! It's an exhausting ride he takes you on, man I forgot to eat my popcorn and by the time i finally wanted some my wife had eaten all of it, but hey I was so immersed into the movie that time stood still and i forgot everything around me.Go and see it, this one gets my full recommendation, the only reason it's not a 10 is due to the fact it's not a completely new type of movie, however this one is done as a good action movie should be made, i don't see how they could have made it better, I really can't, go watch it and have a good time while you do it, it will put a big smile on your face that's for sure.\n",

Thus I am quite disappointed on how this mission never seemed too difficult , let alone impossible.Action was okay. Car chase was funny, but not exciting. Jumping off the cliff seemed forced to me. Why would you keep driving uphill when you can take short cuts to reach the train. It wasn't even a fast train. The key kept being stolen from pockets too many times which makes you wonder how lazy the scripting was. Kill old gf to make new gf was also lazy writing.Unlike other MIs, Ethan had no single smart move or plan. It felt more like let's go and see what happens.Am not sure how MI fans ignored all these weaknesses and gave this film 8+ rating.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: This was a great movie. However, it lost a star from me for making the audience believe Ilsa is dead. They've spent two films building up Ilsa as being Ethan's equal, and hinted at an eventual romance. She's been able to fight off multiple men bare-handed yet she meets her demise by one guy when she has a sword? Then they brush past her death like it means nothing, only for her to be replaced by a new woman. I thought it was a huge disservice to the character.I know Rebecca Ferguson is very busy so she might have asked to leave, but I'm hoping this isn't the end for my favorite character in these films. She deserves a happy ending, or at least a better death than the one she received in this movie. It really took me out of the rest of the film. Hopefully, we'll see her again in Part Two.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Remember that classic MI scene where they broke in at CIA, and Cruise was hanging from the ceiling using wires? It's not a huge setpiece, but that scene is a nailbiting example of ingenious problem solving.In 'Dead Reckoning' there's none of that. Here it's keys changing hands every 10 minutes that is suppose to pass as suspense. And of course the only true selling point: the stunts performed by Tom Cruise.But I want and expect more than that.A large part of the film is devoted to people sitting or standing in a room, explaining what the plot is. Endless talking and explaining. We are told in several scenes the same information we just heard. Worst one is Benji, who is merely there to repeat things for someone in the cast, to make sure everyone in the audience knows what is going on. That is sloppy writing. One of the biggest no-no's as a screenwriter is resolving to \"so what you are saying is, that...\" info sharing. Benji does this all the time. And he is as incompetent as usual. And he is supposed to be a part of a small and unique team that is saving the world? Really?I hope MI:8 isn't just another Tom Cruise stunt reel where it looks like they make the story up as the go along, as long as all marks are checked in the end (running, face swapping, dealing with heights etc), and where character development takes a backseat. Bigger is not always better. And the action ALWAYS has to serve the story, not the other way around.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: After the first 30 minutes that promised an intellectual action thriller, the film starts its nosedive into mediocrity by introducing a thief who constantly indulges in disloyalty, for petty gains, towards the IMF and Hunt, but is held in high regards by Hunt. For the life of me, I couldn't understand why. The film also doesn't bother with it.Neither is it concerned with the so called action set pieces. _Fallout_ had plethora of those, one after the other, tied together by a cogent story line. For all its hype, it has 2-3 in a run time of close to 160 minutes, which tested my patience.Reading it's critics' reviews post viewing make me feel as if they have been written by the Entity, the AI behemoth at the center of this. The perceived entertainment value implied by them is not even remotely connected with the reality.It is no wonder that it is faltering at the US box office. It is no Top Gun- Maverick. Crowds are going to turn up, especially outside the US, because of Cruise's star power. But I don't believe this will please most of them.Disappointing.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: An absolute masterclass in producing an enjoyable action movie. Cinematography was great, the story was paced extremely well, and the casting of ALL roles was absolutely perfect.Cruise, Pegg and Rhames were awesome as always, Whigham and Davis were great additions, but the power quartet of Ferguson, Atwell, Klementieff and Kirby, really went above and beyond in making this movie perfect. Not to mention the chilling confidence of Morales as Gabriel, who practically oozes tangible danger.From the pre-opening credits scene to the final act, if you're like me, you will be on the edge of your seat - especially during any fight scene that involves Ferguson or Klementieff - and whilst there are moments that the tempo slows down to advance the story, it is always completely captivating.The single, solitary, disappointment comes as the credits roll, and you remember you're going to have to wait until next year to see how it ends.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Absolutely superb! Was hoping they could do the impossible and surpass Fallout! And Cruise, McQuarrie and co have accomplished this in spades, delivering the best spy/ action thriller in years.It is a next level masterclass of a film, with everything you would expect from an Mission Impossible film and more.The cast are great, with the new additions adding so much to the usual MI crew. The stunts are performed to the usual high standard and give you that Wow feeling you want, The story is fantastic, leaving you wanting more, setting up Part Two really wellGo see this on the best screen possible.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: It should be impossible to fumble the bag so badly on a nostalgia trip movie like this. Just let Tom Cruise run, do some crazy stunts and play the iconic theme music. But no they gotta drag on for three hours with a meaningless storyline just for it to be one part of an incomplete movie. Like whatever happened to movie editing? There's no reason for this movie to be this long and a lot of the content is completely unnecessary to move the plot forward. I don't expect MI movies to have watertight logic but then atleast the writers shouldn't twist themselves into knots thinking they're making a deeper movie than they are, the sooner these movie trends with AI, quantum space tunneling, multiverse nonsense end the better it is for good storylines.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: This latest Mission: Impossible movie is a slam dunk that needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible. Tom Cruise certainly knows how to make a movie. In another universe Cruse could have been Iron Man and I always felt that his aggression with the Mission: Impossible franchise was his way of making up for that. That's probably why the dialog in this movie felt like Ethan Hawk was captain America or something and they are going up against a Bonafede supervillain in the form of an A. I system. As far as I'm concern the best villain of the franchise snice the late and great Phillip Seymour Huffman.The Avengers Assemble as franchise regulars Simon Pegg as Dunn and Ving Rhimes, who I say with glee, started this franchise with Cruse as Luther, make their return as IMF agents. Rebecca Ferguson reprises her role from the last movie and Haley Atwell is in the movie as well, but none of this makes me as happy as Ving still being in the franchise.The action sequences are so good in this picture. It was worth having to stay in me seat for almost three hours just so they can add a little more action in-between the Hero's journey dialogue.And this is just part one!? Part two has some big shoes to fill!\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: I love Tom Cruise movies, but this one feels pretty contrived. Beyond the plot, Grace was the biggest detriment to the movie. The character started out amusing but her shtick became insufferable and Ethan's infatuation idiotic. How they handled Ilsa feels both rushed and cheap, with no emotional weight felt. The biggest stunt was spoiled beforehand which I suppose did its job in getting me in the seat, but totally ruins the moment in film. The final act also lacked any tension and was honestly a little boring - there wasn't any real cleverness.Still, it was humorous throughout, had a good amount of charm and the production value is evident. That's enough for me to be above average but it's unlikely I'll watch the followup in theater.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: As a hardout Mission fan. I can confirm 5 years was definitely worth the wait. The film is extremally charming and filled with exciting humor, action and story-telling. Tom and Hayley really bring the film so much joy and create wonderful chemistry. The chase scene in Rome puts you on the edge of your seat and nothing prepares you for the daring things Tom and Hayley pull off in the train sequence.. Tom really understands the action genre and did not disappoint with this film. There is a perfect blend between foundation building for the story and the action sequences. The film is a beautiful set up to the part 2 coming next year.. Brilliant Watch 100/10.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Straight up Dead Reckoning Part 1 was fine. I think it's the weakest out of the last four instalments.I can't put my finger on one exact thing but it just felt a little underdone compared to the last few M:I and was expecting big things the whole movie. It was a combination of things like the acting felt a little weak I guess, the script was just fine, the action was decent but not great compared to other M:I and to the likes of John Wick that I'm now used to. The plot with the A. I is nothing new but it's always still interesting and especially at a time in the real world where the advancements seem to be heating up but the whole pickpocketing the key for 2 hours also got boring so fast. Too many cliches started piling up. The hand to hand combat was some of the weakest stuff I've seen it a while especially the Venice bridge scene, it looked awful, like I could see the choreography. The best scene for me was the desert storm at the start which really had my attention but everything after that seemed just average.I don't know if everyone else is now completely over their only trick being having someone go as someone else with these masks. It's so boring to me now and at a stage I'm kinda rolling my eyes. I really hope the machine blowing a fuse means we have seen the last of them.Tom Cruise is awesome with the stunts he does and will always have respect for the things him doing them but I really wish they didn't show the motorbike cliff jump scene in the trailer. What you see in the trailer is literally the whole stunt, don't get me wrong it's truly impressive but they showed the whole thing and just completely killed it for me.I'm slightly bummed with this one and just coming off seeing Indian Jones and having a lot more fun watching that. I don't care about runtimes but you have to have me sucked in and the whole time, I felt the time...People will love this movie but M:I may have fizzled out with me a bit after this one.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Greetings again from the darkness. The challenge in continuing the \"Mission: Impossible\" franchise is that fans expect each entry to be \"bigger\" and more awe-inspiring than the last. With the seventh film in the series, and the third straight he has directed, writer-director Christopher McQuarrie and superstar actor and daredevil Tom Cruise have managed to accomplish what seemed unlikely ... they have delivered Ethan Hunt's biggest and grandest mission yet. Prepare to be awed by the action.You should know that this is \"Part One\" and it runs 163 minutes, a full hour longer than most movies, and exponentially more expensive to produce. All this during an age when ultra-high-budget blockbusters are being rumored to be fading from public interest. Of course, we are only one year removed from Tom Cruise's TOP GUN: MAVERICK being credited with 'saving cinema', so stay on alert for a 'sky is falling' panic. McQuarrie co-wrote the script with Erik Jendresen (\"Band of Brothers\"), and they remain faithful to the characters and storylines established by the TV series creator, Bruce Geller.There may never have been an actor more suited to a recurring role than Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt (Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones might be the closest). The story itself is fairly straightforward, even if the item being chased often feels like a MacGuffin. Your questioning of how a 'simple' spy-thriller can be effective is understandable, yet it's fascinating to watch as Ethan Hunt's mission in life as an agent is evaluated, as is the cost he's paid as a man. Providing a contemporary theme, the obscure object of desire is an all-powerful key (actually two parts of a key) based on controlling an all-encompassing Artificial Intelligence (AI).In a twist on a familiar theme (and a classic comedy film), we have Airports, Trains, and EVs, the latter being a tiny Fiat with handcuffs. Still, the car chase is everything we might hope, while the high-tech facial search in the airport sequence delivers the thrills for techie viewers, and the train sparring occurs inside as well as on top. And lest you be worried, there are enough Cruise sprint scenes here to put CHARIOTS OF FIRE to shame.Familiar faces include Ethan Hunt's team of Luther (Ving Rhames, who along with Cruise, has appeared in all 7 MI films), Benji (Simon Pegg), and Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). It's nice to again see (and hear) Henry Czerny as Kittridge, Vanessa Kirby as arms dealer The White Widow, and Esai Morales - as Gabriel, the required villain in search of the same key as our good guys. New faces include Haylee Atwell as master pickpocket Grace, whose soul may or may not be beyond salvation; Cary Elwes as agency director Denlinger; Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis as officers after rogue Hunt; and Pom Klementieff as a hired assassin.The stunt work here is outstanding, and of course, Tom Cruise is renowned for personally handling many of the most breathtaking acts - the most memorable one here being his riding of a motorcycle off a cliff. This stunt has a 'making of' video that's been available for a while. As movie goers, we've never seen anything like it. This part one was originally scheduled for release in 2021 (thanks a lot, COVID), and now Part Two is set for 2024. It's been 27 years since the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE (1996) with Jon Voight ... Cruise was 34 in that one. This particular mission is the biggest yet, and it would certainly be impossible for the rest of us. It's a mission that will be closed out in Part Two, and simultaneously bring an end to Cruise's remarkable run as Ethan Hunt.Opening July 12, 2023.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: This movie started out promising but by the end, it just felt like being robbed of two and a half hours. I am a big fan of the MI movies (including MI2, which people seem to hate) and I could appreciate this movie for the few scenes that it did right, but it treats the audience like idiots in its bland, repetitive storyline (how many times do we need to hear the words \"the key\" and \"the entity\"? It was as if the writers of this movie just gave up on their jobs when they wrote this. Easily the weakest MI movie ever filmed. It had me staring at my watch every 20 minutes. As others have mentioned, the character development in this movie is also truly awful. I have barely any interest in seeing Part Two of Dead Reckoning at this point. The high scores this movie is getting absolutely baffle me. This movie by no means deserves a score higher than a 6 or a 6.5.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Basically, this movie is big, loud, and stupid.Definitely TOO loud, in fact. The music attempts to turn even the most minor scene into some sort of heart-pounding climax.There are endless ridiculous fights in which Tom Cruise is predictably unstoppable, no matter how many opponents he's up against. Slim girls get to beat up multiple men. (Emily Blunt was right when, commenting on a fight in \"Sicario\" in which, refreshingly, she loses to a bigger guy, she noted that Hollywood fight scenes in which 110-pound women whip larger males are \"so cheesy.\")The dull, tepid, way-too-pretty villain is, implausibly, a formidable fighter but sure doesn't look like one. An action movie is only as good as its villain is evil; this guy looks like a French fashion mogul.He and Cruise fight on top of -- wait for it -- a moving train! Haven't we seen that ridiculous sort of thing a hundred times before?The tediously overcomplicated plot makes it hard to keep track of who's on which side, nor do we care. Apparently, as is usual these days, we're supposed to root against the U. S. government.In all scenes involving conversations, virtually EVERY line is merely plot exposition in which characters tell us, in stilted dialogue, what's going on, what's supposed to happen, and how we're supposed to feel.The much-touted parachute jump is actually disappointing. It's over quite fast, and its main source of interest is that, if you've seen the promotional video, you know that Cruise himself actually made that jump.The only truly enjoyable sequence -- the cleverly worked-out rescue attempts on the falling train -- comes at the end, after nearly two and a half hours of empty cartoonish nonsense...Including, of course, an overlong cartoonish car chase, obligatory in dumb summer movies.\n",

It feels huge the whole time however I must say I while the set pieces were stellar, the hand to hand combat scenes were not great and a big step down from the last film (Fallout).Thebeginning is slow with a lot of expository being dumped (more than you'd usually see) but once it gets going it is pretty nonstop.This is a good chapter and Haley Atwell shines but it is nowhere near my favorite of the series.7/10Mi rankingsMi6 Fallout\n",

            "Skipping non-numeric rating: 'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part I (M:I7) is another strong entry in the action/spy series, with Ethan (Cruise) looking slightly older, but not less determined to save the world. I believe the sequel to this film will be his last outing - but we'll see. This time, there's some Skynet-like sentient-AI that's manipulating nefarious types to take over the world, so the IMF team are out to get the two halves of key that can stop it.Isla (Ferguson), Benji (Pegg) and Luther (Rhames) are back, as well as CIA boss Kittridge (Czerny), with Grace (Atwell), a thief, being the newcomer. The bad guys that keep thwarting them are Gabriel (Morales) from Ethan's past, and Paris (Klementieff). The consistency of having McQuarrie as director of the two previous films helps, with everything feeling assured and this working as a really solid follow-up to 'Fallout'.There's some funny moments, some sincere ones, and some of Ethan running, as contractually-obliged. The whole final scene on the train is excellent, with so many things happening, but there's plenty of good set-pieces throughout, including a good car chase. However, the piece-de-resistance is the motorbike off the cliff into a BASE jump is something else. The fact Cruise did it for real, multiple times, is crazy and inspiring.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Man.... I wish I loved this movie more than I did. Don't get me wrong, it's a solid action movie with jaw-dropping stunts (some of the best in the series), but as a Mission: Impossible movie, it felt like a small step backward for the franchise. Fallout had mind-blowing action sequences and stunt work, along with developing Ethan's relationship with Ilsa, providing closure with Julia, showing the lengths Ethan would go to protect those closest to him, and battling an imposing villain. Dead Reckoning: Part One stretches the movie across two films only to seemingly showcase action spectacle after action spectacle while sacrificing character development. Characters I have grown to love over a decade of films felt sidelined, ignored, or wasted. Hayley Atwell's new character chewed up most of the screen time, and while she was fantastic, I wanted to see more of the original team. The new villain had an inconsistent ability that confused more than intimidated. There were some important emotional moments that I just didn't feel the weight of when I definitely should have. Part Two might tie everything together and make me enjoy Part One more in retrospect, but unfortunately, I left wanting more from this one.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Just got out of seeing this movie. I am really disappointed that they totally killed off the potential relationship between Ethan and Ilsa. I am totally OK with her dying but the way that they did it and how anti-climactic it was after building up her character so much in the previous two films. Just seems like she would've deserved a better death than that. Also, what was the point of showing the two characters getting closer to each other, and in the last film, his ex-wife, basically giving them permission to move forward when you're just going to kill her off like that. Honestly, Rebecca Ferguson revised this franchise two movies ago and I think killing off her character was a big mistake. Even in the scenes that she's in it doesn't even seem like she's playing the same person. I wonder if they wrote her out of the movie because she's too busy with the rest of her work. Hayley Atwell's character doesn't make sense to me either. Just put her in the IMF because she can pick some pockets? This all seems forced. Maybe most won't agree, but I think this development totally ruined the movie for me.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Just saw this one in a theatre, and boy... what an adrenaline rush it is. The latest Mission Impossible features some of the most incredible stunts ever put to camera. The story is absolutely exhilarating and continues to bring new life to a veteran movie franchise. The sheer scale of this movie is epic, and with every twist and turn of the movie, you cannot help but marvel at the incredible sets used to bring this movie to life. Such a movie begs to be seen on the biggest screen possible where you can truly feel the grandeur of the film. Tom Cruise has once again delivered one of the best movies of the year, and I cannot recommend that you see it enough!\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: To me, a new M:I film is an event. From Part 4 onwards, they've been spectacular (all 10/10's).There's some good stuff here for sure, and overall it's a solid 8, but it's simply not as good as previous entries.I kept noticing that a lot of scenes had just 2 or 3 people in them, and I kept imagining the crew all masked up, as well as the cast when the camera wasn't on them. It can't be easy to make a huge movie like this during a pandemic, but it definitely shows.The A. I. plot is quite good, and Hunt's as-yet-unknown backstory quite intriguing, but the whole story basically revolves around: \"I've got the key, now she's got the key, now he's got the key\" etc. So much pick-pocketing.Also, I really wish they hadn't ruined the motorcycle jump in the promos. If you've seen the promo, you've seen the scene. There are really only 3 or 4 action sequences, and nothing we haven't really seen before. I actually enjoyed the first desert shoot-out the best.And- oh!- the exposition! There's a scene near the beginning that reminded me of a Neil Breen(!) movie, where powerful people sit in a room and just spout buzz words like \"nuclear war,\" \"economic collapse,\" \"dogs and cats living together\" etc.THAT said, it's still an 8/10. Tom always gives it his best, the rest of the cast is good (especially all four female leads) and I thought the added humour with Hunt's character was a nice touch. I'd rather watch this ten times over than any blatant cyncial Disney cash-grab.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Good God. I feel ashamed for approaching this film with a modicum of doubt that Tom would still be able to deliver. Unbelievably, this epic actually manages to top the brilliant Fallout. Tom is literally going to die if he keeps doing these stunts. The motorbike sequence is utterly ludicrous. Intriguing plot with actual stakes and some familiar faces ably supported by brilliant new allies and villains. Sets up Part II perfectly with a sensational finale that homages Back to the Future 3, MI:1 and Speed. It is funny, action packed, polished and exhilarating. Harrison was great last week, but Tom is still the King. 9/10.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: I was lucky to be able to watch this 4 days before its official release in Czech Republic as a pre-premiere (didn't know such a thing existed) and it was the first time I've felt real excitement to go watch a film at the cinema in ages thanks to the recent genius combination of Fallout and Top Gun 2.I know what they were trying to do with this film. Bringing Kittridge back and a convoluted train finale all harked back to the 1st movie that sparked it all off. Explaining that convoluted storyline along the way harks back to the criticisms made about that same first film.The sky jump stunt was an attempt to beat the stunts from Tom Cruise in previous installments that have now become a beloved trademark of the franchise.But this film unfortunately overall is most reminiscent of the second installment which was Tom Cruise centric and lacked any real impossible mission requiring teamwork, real stakes and ingenious problem solving.In fact, it could have even been intentional that this film reminds the viewer of Mission Impossible 2. The photos in the film of past Ethan Hunt when searching for present Ethan Hunt show him with his longer hair as he looked in that second film.Ultimately, I expected the story to be way better than what we get in this instalment.There are 2 guys that keep appearing at each scene trying to catch Ethan which seems a very cheap simple story.And the very simple plot is explained in long scenes to make it seem way more complicated that it actually is (people complained there should be more explanation in the first film, but at least the plot in the first film actually required brain power), and I have to say that some of the acting is quite poor at times, not helped by some rather cheesy lines in the script, including the lines and accents in the opening Russian submarine sequence.There is also not that much action. 3 main action sequences for a close to 3 hour movie, which are the desert shoot out at the beginning, the Venice car chase, and the train crash at the end.I thought the alleyway fight scene, which some have praised, was really quite subpar and not very enthralling.The best action scene is the Venice car chase because it is genuinely funny (yes, because it is excellently laugh out loud funny, but not in any way tense); I never had the feeling that I was on the edge of my seat.The motorcycle sky jump scene was a major disappointment after the hype because if you didn't know Cruise actually did do that stunt, they used so much CGI that people would just assume it was computer generated. It actually reminded me of Pierce Brosnan's riding the tsunami in Die Another Day (sorry Tom! The stunt is still awesome!).The same for the train at the end. I know they actually made that train, and probably actually threw it off a bridge, but it doesn't look real. Though it is a long action finale and very fun to watch, for me the lack of realism takes away any tension. You are enjoying it for its visual value, but again not feeling any 'wow' factor or tension.At the end of Fallout, for example, you really felt Ethan Hunt was battered, bruised, worn out and still fighting to save humanity. There is none of that.The most tragic thing about this movie is that, unlike in the best of the previous films, we're back to the team being irrelevant in this one. Benji and Luther don't actually do very much.And poor Ilsa. Fallout ended with Ethan's ex-wife essentially giving him permission to move on and be with Ilsa.The relationship between Ilsa and Hunt had been built up over two excellent movies - Rogue Nation and Fallout - and in this film she says almost nothing, looks grumpy and sad all the time, and dies in an anticlimactic fight that is literally spelt out to the audience as a way to replace her with newcomer Grace.Grace, played by Hayley Atwell, is good. A likeable character and a capable actress, but I don't get the story unless Rebecca Ferguson said she wants out the franchise.The film is all about chasing \"the key.\" No twists. No high stakes. There is virtually no grittiness in this outing. It feels very light.Ultimately I was hoping to enjoy a quality film in the franchise. A movie like Oblivion, Edge of Tomorrow, Fallout, Top Gun 2 or American Made that you can show to anyone and say these are recent really high quality films starring this guy called Tom Cruise.This is not one of those films.It is more like The Mummy. It is better than Mission Impossible 2 but not better than any of the others in the franchise.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One confirms that Mission Impossible is the best franchise currently going and possibly ever made. A 2 hour 43 minute adrenaline rush that contains some of the best action sequences put to film, embarrasses the majority of the competition out there and sets the stage for a magnificent part 2 whilst still being a satisfying adventure in its own right.This is possibly the most open and obvious a Mission film has been with its deeper meaning for cinema and what aspect of Cruise's career is being dissected this time with a film that focuses on Ethan's relationship with women and basically outright declares AI to be a soulless monster and how the human element is always needed (perfect film to release during a writer's strike).Tom Cruise is perfect as Ethan Hunt and the strongest aspect this time round is when the film explores what made Ethan who he is and reminds you he genuinely cares about his team but that comes at a cost. Physically, the madman is still going strong with his stunts, driving a bike off a cliff in truly breathtaking fashion.Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg and Rebecca Ferguson remain the best IMF team and all play to their strengths here. The longer this series goes on the more authentic their growing friendship feels. Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis get more than expected and their buddy cop antics are a lot of fun.With Esai Morales' charismatic yet terrifying Gabriel and Pom Klementieff's terrific henchman of few words, this franchise finally has more good villains than bad. The return of Henry Czerny as Kittridge is glorious and he remains as gleefully despicable as his first appearance.The best new addition is easily Hayley Atwell. She plays a type of character never seen before in these films which makes her character and dynamic with Cruise fresh in comparison to everyone who's come before and their chemistry is magnetic. Instantaneous from the second they interact.Christopher McQuarrie's direction is phenomenal. The action sequences are suitably practical (this is how you spend $290 million), and the camera gets as close to the action as humanly possible, he remains one of the best in the business working at this scale. There's plenty of canted angles as a nice homage to De Palma's original and it helps give this one its own style in comparison to McQuarrie's previous entries.The pacing is really impressive with the film feeling like it's in a perpetual third act from its first airport heist (which is so much fun). Lorne Balfe does the music once again and yet again it's a highlight of the film, he knows how to elevate everything so well and really hammers home the emotional beats.\n",

            "\"So what you're telling me is you plan to establish a new world order if you get that key and if someone stops you that would be bad?!\"Has Ethan Hunt suddenly become this vanilla James Bond? With the Bond girl cycling through every few films? Lazy writing. Not natural feeling. Forced. BlighIt pains me to give this so low.The truth is, this movie is mindless entertaining action. Tom Cruise delivers on some awesome stunts (seldom compared to other MI films). It's not horrible. It's fun entertainment, but a scour on the (in my opinion) reputable authentic feeling mission impossible series.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: So you probably watched IM 6 and said, they can't make it any better can they? Or Top Gun 2, guess again, this is an adrenaline action movie with a good story, well written, action scenes that just blow you away, not a boring moment and you are on the edge of your seat all the time, this is how you make movies! Tom Cruise did it again, WOW!! It's an exhausting ride he takes you on, man I forgot to eat my popcorn and by the time i finally wanted some my wife had eaten all of it, but hey I was so immersed into the movie that time stood still and i forgot everything around me.Go and see it, this one gets my full recommendation, the only reason it's not a 10 is due to the fact it's not a completely new type of movie, however this one is done as a good action movie should be made, i don't see how they could have made it better, I really can't, go watch it and have a good time while you do it, it will put a big smile on your face that's for sure.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Am huge fan of MI franchise. The best part about all MI movies were how they plan and pull off an impossible mission. Thus I am quite disappointed on how this mission never seemed too difficult , let alone impossible.Action was okay. Car chase was funny, but not exciting. Jumping off the cliff seemed forced to me. Why would you keep driving uphill when you can take short cuts to reach the train. It wasn't even a fast train. The key kept being stolen from pockets too many times which makes you wonder how lazy the scripting was. Kill old gf to make new gf was also lazy writing.Unlike other MIs, Ethan had no single smart move or plan. It felt more like let's go and see what happens.Am not sure how MI fans ignored all these weaknesses and gave this film 8+ rating.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: This was a great movie. However, it lost a star from me for making the audience believe Ilsa is dead. They've spent two films building up Ilsa as being Ethan's equal, and hinted at an eventual romance. She's been able to fight off multiple men bare-handed yet she meets her demise by one guy when she has a sword? Then they brush past her death like it means nothing, only for her to be replaced by a new woman. I thought it was a huge disservice to the character.I know Rebecca Ferguson is very busy so she might have asked to leave, but I'm hoping this isn't the end for my favorite character in these films. She deserves a happy ending, or at least a better death than the one she received in this movie. It really took me out of the rest of the film. Hopefully, we'll see her again in Part Two.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Remember that classic MI scene where they broke in at CIA, and Cruise was hanging from the ceiling using wires? It's not a huge setpiece, but that scene is a nailbiting example of ingenious problem solving.In 'Dead Reckoning' there's none of that. Here it's keys changing hands every 10 minutes that is suppose to pass as suspense. And of course the only true selling point: the stunts performed by Tom Cruise.But I want and expect more than that.A large part of the film is devoted to people sitting or standing in a room, explaining what the plot is. Endless talking and explaining. We are told in several scenes the same information we just heard. Worst one is Benji, who is merely there to repeat things for someone in the cast, to make sure everyone in the audience knows what is going on. That is sloppy writing. One of the biggest no-no's as a screenwriter is resolving to \"so what you are saying is, that...\" info sharing. Benji does this all the time. And he is as incompetent as usual. And he is supposed to be a part of a small and unique team that is saving the world? Really?I hope MI:8 isn't just another Tom Cruise stunt reel where it looks like they make the story up as the go along, as long as all marks are checked in the end (running, face swapping, dealing with heights etc), and where character development takes a backseat. Bigger is not always better. And the action ALWAYS has to serve the story, not the other way around.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: After the first 30 minutes that promised an intellectual action thriller, the film starts its nosedive into mediocrity by introducing a thief who constantly indulges in disloyalty, for petty gains, towards the IMF and Hunt, but is held in high regards by Hunt. For the life of me, I couldn't understand why. The film also doesn't bother with it.Neither is it concerned with the so called action set pieces. _Fallout_ had plethora of those, one after the other, tied together by a cogent story line. For all its hype, it has 2-3 in a run time of close to 160 minutes, which tested my patience.Reading it's critics' reviews post viewing make me feel as if they have been written by the Entity, the AI behemoth at the center of this. The perceived entertainment value implied by them is not even remotely connected with the reality.It is no wonder that it is faltering at the US box office. It is no Top Gun- Maverick. Crowds are going to turn up, especially outside the US, because of Cruise's star power. But I don't believe this will please most of them.Disappointing.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: An absolute masterclass in producing an enjoyable action movie. Cinematography was great, the story was paced extremely well, and the casting of ALL roles was absolutely perfect.Cruise, Pegg and Rhames were awesome as always, Whigham and Davis were great additions, but the power quartet of Ferguson, Atwell, Klementieff and Kirby, really went above and beyond in making this movie perfect. Not to mention the chilling confidence of Morales as Gabriel, who practically oozes tangible danger.From the pre-opening credits scene to the final act, if you're like me, you will be on the edge of your seat - especially during any fight scene that involves Ferguson or Klementieff - and whilst there are moments that the tempo slows down to advance the story, it is always completely captivating.The single, solitary, disappointment comes as the credits roll, and you remember you're going to have to wait until next year to see how it ends.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Absolutely superb! Was hoping they could do the impossible and surpass Fallout! And Cruise, McQuarrie and co have accomplished this in spades, delivering the best spy/ action thriller in years.It is a next level masterclass of a film, with everything you would expect from an Mission Impossible film and more.The cast are great, with the new additions adding so much to the usual MI crew. The stunts are performed to the usual high standard and give you that Wow feeling you want, The story is fantastic, leaving you wanting more, setting up Part Two really wellGo see this on the best screen possible.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: It should be impossible to fumble the bag so badly on a nostalgia trip movie like this. Just let Tom Cruise run, do some crazy stunts and play the iconic theme music. But no they gotta drag on for three hours with a meaningless storyline just for it to be one part of an incomplete movie. Like whatever happened to movie editing? There's no reason for this movie to be this long and a lot of the content is completely unnecessary to move the plot forward. I don't expect MI movies to have watertight logic but then atleast the writers shouldn't twist themselves into knots thinking they're making a deeper movie than they are, the sooner these movie trends with AI, quantum space tunneling, multiverse nonsense end the better it is for good storylines.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: This latest Mission: Impossible movie is a slam dunk that needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible. Tom Cruise certainly knows how to make a movie. In another universe Cruse could have been Iron Man and I always felt that his aggression with the Mission: Impossible franchise was his way of making up for that. That's probably why the dialog in this movie felt like Ethan Hawk was captain America or something and they are going up against a Bonafede supervillain in the form of an A. I system. As far as I'm concern the best villain of the franchise snice the late and great Phillip Seymour Huffman.The Avengers Assemble as franchise regulars Simon Pegg as Dunn and Ving Rhimes, who I say with glee, started this franchise with Cruse as Luther, make their return as IMF agents. Rebecca Ferguson reprises her role from the last movie and Haley Atwell is in the movie as well, but none of this makes me as happy as Ving still being in the franchise.The action sequences are so good in this picture. It was worth having to stay in me seat for almost three hours just so they can add a little more action in-between the Hero's journey dialogue.And this is just part one!? Part two has some big shoes to fill!\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: I love Tom Cruise movies, but this one feels pretty contrived. Beyond the plot, Grace was the biggest detriment to the movie. The character started out amusing but her shtick became insufferable and Ethan's infatuation idiotic. How they handled Ilsa feels both rushed and cheap, with no emotional weight felt. The biggest stunt was spoiled beforehand which I suppose did its job in getting me in the seat, but totally ruins the moment in film. The final act also lacked any tension and was honestly a little boring - there wasn't any real cleverness.Still, it was humorous throughout, had a good amount of charm and the production value is evident. That's enough for me to be above average but it's unlikely I'll watch the followup in theater.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: As a hardout Mission fan. I can confirm 5 years was definitely worth the wait. The film is extremally charming and filled with exciting humor, action and story-telling. Tom and Hayley really bring the film so much joy and create wonderful chemistry. The chase scene in Rome puts you on the edge of your seat and nothing prepares you for the daring things Tom and Hayley pull off in the train sequence.. Tom really understands the action genre and did not disappoint with this film. There is a perfect blend between foundation building for the story and the action sequences. The film is a beautiful set up to the part 2 coming next year.. Brilliant Watch 100/10.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Straight up Dead Reckoning Part 1 was fine. I think it's the weakest out of the last four instalments.I can't put my finger on one exact thing but it just felt a little underdone compared to the last few M:I and was expecting big things the whole movie. It was a combination of things like the acting felt a little weak I guess, the script was just fine, the action was decent but not great compared to other M:I and to the likes of John Wick that I'm now used to. The plot with the A. I is nothing new but it's always still interesting and especially at a time in the real world where the advancements seem to be heating up but the whole pickpocketing the key for 2 hours also got boring so fast. Too many cliches started piling up. The hand to hand combat was some of the weakest stuff I've seen it a while especially the Venice bridge scene, it looked awful, like I could see the choreography. The best scene for me was the desert storm at the start which really had my attention but everything after that seemed just average.I don't know if everyone else is now completely over their only trick being having someone go as someone else with these masks. It's so boring to me now and at a stage I'm kinda rolling my eyes. I really hope the machine blowing a fuse means we have seen the last of them.Tom Cruise is awesome with the stunts he does and will always have respect for the things him doing them but I really wish they didn't show the motorbike cliff jump scene in the trailer. What you see in the trailer is literally the whole stunt, don't get me wrong it's truly impressive but they showed the whole thing and just completely killed it for me.I'm slightly bummed with this one and just coming off seeing Indian Jones and having a lot more fun watching that. I don't care about runtimes but you have to have me sucked in and the whole time, I felt the time...People will love this movie but M:I may have fizzled out with me a bit after this one.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Greetings again from the darkness. The challenge in continuing the \"Mission: Impossible\" franchise is that fans expect each entry to be \"bigger\" and more awe-inspiring than the last. With the seventh film in the series, and the third straight he has directed, writer-director Christopher McQuarrie and superstar actor and daredevil Tom Cruise have managed to accomplish what seemed unlikely ... they have delivered Ethan Hunt's biggest and grandest mission yet. Prepare to be awed by the action.You should know that this is \"Part One\" and it runs 163 minutes, a full hour longer than most movies, and exponentially more expensive to produce. All this during an age when ultra-high-budget blockbusters are being rumored to be fading from public interest. Of course, we are only one year removed from Tom Cruise's TOP GUN: MAVERICK being credited with 'saving cinema', so stay on alert for a 'sky is falling' panic. McQuarrie co-wrote the script with Erik Jendresen (\"Band of Brothers\"), and they remain faithful to the characters and storylines established by the TV series creator, Bruce Geller.There may never have been an actor more suited to a recurring role than Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt (Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones might be the closest). The story itself is fairly straightforward, even if the item being chased often feels like a MacGuffin. Your questioning of how a 'simple' spy-thriller can be effective is understandable, yet it's fascinating to watch as Ethan Hunt's mission in life as an agent is evaluated, as is the cost he's paid as a man. Providing a contemporary theme, the obscure object of desire is an all-powerful key (actually two parts of a key) based on controlling an all-encompassing Artificial Intelligence (AI).In a twist on a familiar theme (and a classic comedy film), we have Airports, Trains, and EVs, the latter being a tiny Fiat with handcuffs. Still, the car chase is everything we might hope, while the high-tech facial search in the airport sequence delivers the thrills for techie viewers, and the train sparring occurs inside as well as on top. And lest you be worried, there are enough Cruise sprint scenes here to put CHARIOTS OF FIRE to shame.Familiar faces include Ethan Hunt's team of Luther (Ving Rhames, who along with Cruise, has appeared in all 7 MI films), Benji (Simon Pegg), and Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). It's nice to again see (and hear) Henry Czerny as Kittridge, Vanessa Kirby as arms dealer The White Widow, and Esai Morales - as Gabriel, the required villain in search of the same key as our good guys. New faces include Haylee Atwell as master pickpocket Grace, whose soul may or may not be beyond salvation; Cary Elwes as agency director Denlinger; Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis as officers after rogue Hunt; and Pom Klementieff as a hired assassin.The stunt work here is outstanding, and of course, Tom Cruise is renowned for personally handling many of the most breathtaking acts - the most memorable one here being his riding of a motorcycle off a cliff. This stunt has a 'making of' video that's been available for a while. As movie goers, we've never seen anything like it. This part one was originally scheduled for release in 2021 (thanks a lot, COVID), and now Part Two is set for 2024. It's been 27 years since the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE (1996) with Jon Voight ... Cruise was 34 in that one. This particular mission is the biggest yet, and it would certainly be impossible for the rest of us. It's a mission that will be closed out in Part Two, and simultaneously bring an end to Cruise's remarkable run as Ethan Hunt.Opening July 12, 2023.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: This movie started out promising but by the end, it just felt like being robbed of two and a half hours. I am a big fan of the MI movies (including MI2, which people seem to hate) and I could appreciate this movie for the few scenes that it did right, but it treats the audience like idiots in its bland, repetitive storyline (how many times do we need to hear the words \"the key\" and \"the entity\"? It was as if the writers of this movie just gave up on their jobs when they wrote this. Easily the weakest MI movie ever filmed. It had me staring at my watch every 20 minutes. As others have mentioned, the character development in this movie is also truly awful. I have barely any interest in seeing Part Two of Dead Reckoning at this point. The high scores this movie is getting absolutely baffle me. This movie by no means deserves a score higher than a 6 or a 6.5.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Basically, this movie is big, loud, and stupid.Definitely TOO loud, in fact. The music attempts to turn even the most minor scene into some sort of heart-pounding climax.There are endless ridiculous fights in which Tom Cruise is predictably unstoppable, no matter how many opponents he's up against. Slim girls get to beat up multiple men. (Emily Blunt was right when, commenting on a fight in \"Sicario\" in which, refreshingly, she loses to a bigger guy, she noted that Hollywood fight scenes in which 110-pound women whip larger males are \"so cheesy.\")The dull, tepid, way-too-pretty villain is, implausibly, a formidable fighter but sure doesn't look like one. An action movie is only as good as its villain is evil; this guy looks like a French fashion mogul.He and Cruise fight on top of -- wait for it -- a moving train! Haven't we seen that ridiculous sort of thing a hundred times before?The tediously overcomplicated plot makes it hard to keep track of who's on which side, nor do we care. Apparently, as is usual these days, we're supposed to root against the U. S. government.In all scenes involving conversations, virtually EVERY line is merely plot exposition in which characters tell us, in stilted dialogue, what's going on, what's supposed to happen, and how we're supposed to feel.The much-touted parachute jump is actually disappointing. It's over quite fast, and its main source of interest is that, if you've seen the promotional video, you know that Cruise himself actually made that jump.The only truly enjoyable sequence -- the cleverly worked-out rescue attempts on the falling train -- comes at the end, after nearly two and a half hours of empty cartoonish nonsense...Including, of course, an overlong cartoonish car chase, obligatory in dumb summer movies.\n",

It feels huge the whole time however I must say I while the set pieces were stellar, the hand to hand combat scenes were not great and a big step down from the last film (Fallout).Thebeginning is slow with a lot of expository being dumped (more than you'd usually see) but once it gets going it is pretty nonstop.This is a good chapter and Haley Atwell shines but it is nowhere near my favorite of the series.7/10Mi rankingsMi6 Fallout\n",

            "Skipping non-numeric rating: 'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part I (M:I7) is another strong entry in the action/spy series, with Ethan (Cruise) looking slightly older, but not less determined to save the world. I believe the sequel to this film will be his last outing - but we'll see. This time, there's some Skynet-like sentient-AI that's manipulating nefarious types to take over the world, so the IMF team are out to get the two halves of key that can stop it.Isla (Ferguson), Benji (Pegg) and Luther (Rhames) are back, as well as CIA boss Kittridge (Czerny), with Grace (Atwell), a thief, being the newcomer. The bad guys that keep thwarting them are Gabriel (Morales) from Ethan's past, and Paris (Klementieff). The consistency of having McQuarrie as director of the two previous films helps, with everything feeling assured and this working as a really solid follow-up to 'Fallout'.There's some funny moments, some sincere ones, and some of Ethan running, as contractually-obliged. The whole final scene on the train is excellent, with so many things happening, but there's plenty of good set-pieces throughout, including a good car chase. However, the piece-de-resistance is the motorbike off the cliff into a BASE jump is something else. The fact Cruise did it for real, multiple times, is crazy and inspiring.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Man.... I wish I loved this movie more than I did. Don't get me wrong, it's a solid action movie with jaw-dropping stunts (some of the best in the series), but as a Mission: Impossible movie, it felt like a small step backward for the franchise. Fallout had mind-blowing action sequences and stunt work, along with developing Ethan's relationship with Ilsa, providing closure with Julia, showing the lengths Ethan would go to protect those closest to him, and battling an imposing villain. Dead Reckoning: Part One stretches the movie across two films only to seemingly showcase action spectacle after action spectacle while sacrificing character development. Characters I have grown to love over a decade of films felt sidelined, ignored, or wasted. Hayley Atwell's new character chewed up most of the screen time, and while she was fantastic, I wanted to see more of the original team. The new villain had an inconsistent ability that confused more than intimidated. There were some important emotional moments that I just didn't feel the weight of when I definitely should have. Part Two might tie everything together and make me enjoy Part One more in retrospect, but unfortunately, I left wanting more from this one.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Just got out of seeing this movie. I am really disappointed that they totally killed off the potential relationship between Ethan and Ilsa. I am totally OK with her dying but the way that they did it and how anti-climactic it was after building up her character so much in the previous two films. Just seems like she would've deserved a better death than that. Also, what was the point of showing the two characters getting closer to each other, and in the last film, his ex-wife, basically giving them permission to move forward when you're just going to kill her off like that. Honestly, Rebecca Ferguson revised this franchise two movies ago and I think killing off her character was a big mistake. Even in the scenes that she's in it doesn't even seem like she's playing the same person. I wonder if they wrote her out of the movie because she's too busy with the rest of her work. Hayley Atwell's character doesn't make sense to me either. Just put her in the IMF because she can pick some pockets? This all seems forced. Maybe most won't agree, but I think this development totally ruined the movie for me.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Just saw this one in a theatre, and boy... what an adrenaline rush it is. The latest Mission Impossible features some of the most incredible stunts ever put to camera. The story is absolutely exhilarating and continues to bring new life to a veteran movie franchise. The sheer scale of this movie is epic, and with every twist and turn of the movie, you cannot help but marvel at the incredible sets used to bring this movie to life. Such a movie begs to be seen on the biggest screen possible where you can truly feel the grandeur of the film. Tom Cruise has once again delivered one of the best movies of the year, and I cannot recommend that you see it enough!\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: To me, a new M:I film is an event. From Part 4 onwards, they've been spectacular (all 10/10's).There's some good stuff here for sure, and overall it's a solid 8, but it's simply not as good as previous entries.I kept noticing that a lot of scenes had just 2 or 3 people in them, and I kept imagining the crew all masked up, as well as the cast when the camera wasn't on them. It can't be easy to make a huge movie like this during a pandemic, but it definitely shows.The A. I. plot is quite good, and Hunt's as-yet-unknown backstory quite intriguing, but the whole story basically revolves around: \"I've got the key, now she's got the key, now he's got the key\" etc. So much pick-pocketing.Also, I really wish they hadn't ruined the motorcycle jump in the promos. If you've seen the promo, you've seen the scene. There are really only 3 or 4 action sequences, and nothing we haven't really seen before. I actually enjoyed the first desert shoot-out the best.And- oh!- the exposition! There's a scene near the beginning that reminded me of a Neil Breen(!) movie, where powerful people sit in a room and just spout buzz words like \"nuclear war,\" \"economic collapse,\" \"dogs and cats living together\" etc.THAT said, it's still an 8/10. Tom always gives it his best, the rest of the cast is good (especially all four female leads) and I thought the added humour with Hunt's character was a nice touch. I'd rather watch this ten times over than any blatant cyncial Disney cash-grab.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Good God. I feel ashamed for approaching this film with a modicum of doubt that Tom would still be able to deliver. Unbelievably, this epic actually manages to top the brilliant Fallout. Tom is literally going to die if he keeps doing these stunts. The motorbike sequence is utterly ludicrous. Intriguing plot with actual stakes and some familiar faces ably supported by brilliant new allies and villains. Sets up Part II perfectly with a sensational finale that homages Back to the Future 3, MI:1 and Speed. It is funny, action packed, polished and exhilarating. Harrison was great last week, but Tom is still the King. 9/10.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: I was lucky to be able to watch this 4 days before its official release in Czech Republic as a pre-premiere (didn't know such a thing existed) and it was the first time I've felt real excitement to go watch a film at the cinema in ages thanks to the recent genius combination of Fallout and Top Gun 2.I know what they were trying to do with this film. Bringing Kittridge back and a convoluted train finale all harked back to the 1st movie that sparked it all off. Explaining that convoluted storyline along the way harks back to the criticisms made about that same first film.The sky jump stunt was an attempt to beat the stunts from Tom Cruise in previous installments that have now become a beloved trademark of the franchise.But this film unfortunately overall is most reminiscent of the second installment which was Tom Cruise centric and lacked any real impossible mission requiring teamwork, real stakes and ingenious problem solving.In fact, it could have even been intentional that this film reminds the viewer of Mission Impossible 2. The photos in the film of past Ethan Hunt when searching for present Ethan Hunt show him with his longer hair as he looked in that second film.Ultimately, I expected the story to be way better than what we get in this instalment.There are 2 guys that keep appearing at each scene trying to catch Ethan which seems a very cheap simple story.And the very simple plot is explained in long scenes to make it seem way more complicated that it actually is (people complained there should be more explanation in the first film, but at least the plot in the first film actually required brain power), and I have to say that some of the acting is quite poor at times, not helped by some rather cheesy lines in the script, including the lines and accents in the opening Russian submarine sequence.There is also not that much action. 3 main action sequences for a close to 3 hour movie, which are the desert shoot out at the beginning, the Venice car chase, and the train crash at the end.I thought the alleyway fight scene, which some have praised, was really quite subpar and not very enthralling.The best action scene is the Venice car chase because it is genuinely funny (yes, because it is excellently laugh out loud funny, but not in any way tense); I never had the feeling that I was on the edge of my seat.The motorcycle sky jump scene was a major disappointment after the hype because if you didn't know Cruise actually did do that stunt, they used so much CGI that people would just assume it was computer generated. It actually reminded me of Pierce Brosnan's riding the tsunami in Die Another Day (sorry Tom! The stunt is still awesome!).The same for the train at the end. I know they actually made that train, and probably actually threw it off a bridge, but it doesn't look real. Though it is a long action finale and very fun to watch, for me the lack of realism takes away any tension. You are enjoying it for its visual value, but again not feeling any 'wow' factor or tension.At the end of Fallout, for example, you really felt Ethan Hunt was battered, bruised, worn out and still fighting to save humanity. There is none of that.The most tragic thing about this movie is that, unlike in the best of the previous films, we're back to the team being irrelevant in this one. Benji and Luther don't actually do very much.And poor Ilsa. Fallout ended with Ethan's ex-wife essentially giving him permission to move on and be with Ilsa.The relationship between Ilsa and Hunt had been built up over two excellent movies - Rogue Nation and Fallout - and in this film she says almost nothing, looks grumpy and sad all the time, and dies in an anticlimactic fight that is literally spelt out to the audience as a way to replace her with newcomer Grace.Grace, played by Hayley Atwell, is good. A likeable character and a capable actress, but I don't get the story unless Rebecca Ferguson said she wants out the franchise.The film is all about chasing \"the key.\" No twists. No high stakes. There is virtually no grittiness in this outing. It feels very light.Ultimately I was hoping to enjoy a quality film in the franchise. A movie like Oblivion, Edge of Tomorrow, Fallout, Top Gun 2 or American Made that you can show to anyone and say these are recent really high quality films starring this guy called Tom Cruise.This is not one of those films.It is more like The Mummy. It is better than Mission Impossible 2 but not better than any of the others in the franchise.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One confirms that Mission Impossible is the best franchise currently going and possibly ever made. A 2 hour 43 minute adrenaline rush that contains some of the best action sequences put to film, embarrasses the majority of the competition out there and sets the stage for a magnificent part 2 whilst still being a satisfying adventure in its own right.This is possibly the most open and obvious a Mission film has been with its deeper meaning for cinema and what aspect of Cruise's career is being dissected this time with a film that focuses on Ethan's relationship with women and basically outright declares AI to be a soulless monster and how the human element is always needed (perfect film to release during a writer's strike).Tom Cruise is perfect as Ethan Hunt and the strongest aspect this time round is when the film explores what made Ethan who he is and reminds you he genuinely cares about his team but that comes at a cost. Physically, the madman is still going strong with his stunts, driving a bike off a cliff in truly breathtaking fashion.Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg and Rebecca Ferguson remain the best IMF team and all play to their strengths here. The longer this series goes on the more authentic their growing friendship feels. Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis get more than expected and their buddy cop antics are a lot of fun.With Esai Morales' charismatic yet terrifying Gabriel and Pom Klementieff's terrific henchman of few words, this franchise finally has more good villains than bad. The return of Henry Czerny as Kittridge is glorious and he remains as gleefully despicable as his first appearance.The best new addition is easily Hayley Atwell. She plays a type of character never seen before in these films which makes her character and dynamic with Cruise fresh in comparison to everyone who's come before and their chemistry is magnetic. Instantaneous from the second they interact.Christopher McQuarrie's direction is phenomenal. The action sequences are suitably practical (this is how you spend $290 million), and the camera gets as close to the action as humanly possible, he remains one of the best in the business working at this scale. There's plenty of canted angles as a nice homage to De Palma's original and it helps give this one its own style in comparison to McQuarrie's previous entries.The pacing is really impressive with the film feeling like it's in a perpetual third act from its first airport heist (which is so much fun). Lorne Balfe does the music once again and yet again it's a highlight of the film, he knows how to elevate everything so well and really hammers home the emotional beats.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Ethan Hunt has left the mere secret agent status and has ascended to the all living perfect messiah.There is so much wrong with this movie, which seriously pains me because I seriously love this series. The mission impossible movies have steadily become more convoluted and more stupidly written. This film reaches the peak of absurdity, feeling more like an over the top fast and furious movie. All foolish action, cheap parlor tricks to pull the heart strings (empty relationships), horrible writing, poor plot development.I mean seriously what ever happened to show don't tell?! This is becoming rather ridiculous.*convoluted villain dialogue*\n",
            "\"So what you're telling me is you plan to establish a new world order if you get that key and if someone stops you that would be bad?!\"Has Ethan Hunt suddenly become this vanilla James Bond? With the Bond girl cycling through every few films? Lazy writing. Not natural feeling. Forced. BlighIt pains me to give this so low.The truth is, this movie is mindless entertaining action. Tom Cruise delivers on some awesome stunts (seldom compared to other MI films). It's not horrible. It's fun entertainment, but a scour on the (in my opinion) reputable authentic feeling mission impossible series.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: So you probably watched IM 6 and said, they can't make it any better can they? Or Top Gun 2, guess again, this is an adrenaline action movie with a good story, well written, action scenes that just blow you away, not a boring moment and you are on the edge of your seat all the time, this is how you make movies! Tom Cruise did it again, WOW!! It's an exhausting ride he takes you on, man I forgot to eat my popcorn and by the time i finally wanted some my wife had eaten all of it, but hey I was so immersed into the movie that time stood still and i forgot everything around me.Go and see it, this one gets my full recommendation, the only reason it's not a 10 is due to the fact it's not a completely new type of movie, however this one is done as a good action movie should be made, i don't see how they could have made it better, I really can't, go watch it and have a good time while you do it, it will put a big smile on your face that's for sure.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Am huge fan of MI franchise. The best part about all MI movies were how they plan and pull off an impossible mission. Thus I am quite disappointed on how this mission never seemed too difficult , let alone impossible.Action was okay. Car chase was funny, but not exciting. Jumping off the cliff seemed forced to me. Why would you keep driving uphill when you can take short cuts to reach the train. It wasn't even a fast train. The key kept being stolen from pockets too many times which makes you wonder how lazy the scripting was. Kill old gf to make new gf was also lazy writing.Unlike other MIs, Ethan had no single smart move or plan. It felt more like let's go and see what happens.Am not sure how MI fans ignored all these weaknesses and gave this film 8+ rating.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: This was a great movie. However, it lost a star from me for making the audience believe Ilsa is dead. They've spent two films building up Ilsa as being Ethan's equal, and hinted at an eventual romance. She's been able to fight off multiple men bare-handed yet she meets her demise by one guy when she has a sword? Then they brush past her death like it means nothing, only for her to be replaced by a new woman. I thought it was a huge disservice to the character.I know Rebecca Ferguson is very busy so she might have asked to leave, but I'm hoping this isn't the end for my favorite character in these films. She deserves a happy ending, or at least a better death than the one she received in this movie. It really took me out of the rest of the film. Hopefully, we'll see her again in Part Two.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Remember that classic MI scene where they broke in at CIA, and Cruise was hanging from the ceiling using wires? It's not a huge setpiece, but that scene is a nailbiting example of ingenious problem solving.In 'Dead Reckoning' there's none of that. Here it's keys changing hands every 10 minutes that is suppose to pass as suspense. And of course the only true selling point: the stunts performed by Tom Cruise.But I want and expect more than that.A large part of the film is devoted to people sitting or standing in a room, explaining what the plot is. Endless talking and explaining. We are told in several scenes the same information we just heard. Worst one is Benji, who is merely there to repeat things for someone in the cast, to make sure everyone in the audience knows what is going on. That is sloppy writing. One of the biggest no-no's as a screenwriter is resolving to \"so what you are saying is, that...\" info sharing. Benji does this all the time. And he is as incompetent as usual. And he is supposed to be a part of a small and unique team that is saving the world? Really?I hope MI:8 isn't just another Tom Cruise stunt reel where it looks like they make the story up as the go along, as long as all marks are checked in the end (running, face swapping, dealing with heights etc), and where character development takes a backseat. Bigger is not always better. And the action ALWAYS has to serve the story, not the other way around.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: After the first 30 minutes that promised an intellectual action thriller, the film starts its nosedive into mediocrity by introducing a thief who constantly indulges in disloyalty, for petty gains, towards the IMF and Hunt, but is held in high regards by Hunt. For the life of me, I couldn't understand why. The film also doesn't bother with it.Neither is it concerned with the so called action set pieces. _Fallout_ had plethora of those, one after the other, tied together by a cogent story line. For all its hype, it has 2-3 in a run time of close to 160 minutes, which tested my patience.Reading it's critics' reviews post viewing make me feel as if they have been written by the Entity, the AI behemoth at the center of this. The perceived entertainment value implied by them is not even remotely connected with the reality.It is no wonder that it is faltering at the US box office. It is no Top Gun- Maverick. Crowds are going to turn up, especially outside the US, because of Cruise's star power. But I don't believe this will please most of them.Disappointing.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: An absolute masterclass in producing an enjoyable action movie. Cinematography was great, the story was paced extremely well, and the casting of ALL roles was absolutely perfect.Cruise, Pegg and Rhames were awesome as always, Whigham and Davis were great additions, but the power quartet of Ferguson, Atwell, Klementieff and Kirby, really went above and beyond in making this movie perfect. Not to mention the chilling confidence of Morales as Gabriel, who practically oozes tangible danger.From the pre-opening credits scene to the final act, if you're like me, you will be on the edge of your seat - especially during any fight scene that involves Ferguson or Klementieff - and whilst there are moments that the tempo slows down to advance the story, it is always completely captivating.The single, solitary, disappointment comes as the credits roll, and you remember you're going to have to wait until next year to see how it ends.\n",

            "Skipping non-numeric rating: It should be impossible to fumble the bag so badly on a nostalgia trip movie like this. Just let Tom Cruise run, do some crazy stunts and play the iconic theme music. But no they gotta drag on for three hours with a meaningless storyline just for it to be one part of an incomplete movie. Like whatever happened to movie editing? There's no reason for this movie to be this long and a lot of the content is completely unnecessary to move the plot forward. I don't expect MI movies to have watertight logic but then atleast the writers shouldn't twist themselves into knots thinking they're making a deeper movie than they are, the sooner these movie trends with AI, quantum space tunneling, multiverse nonsense end the better it is for good storylines.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: This latest Mission: Impossible movie is a slam dunk that needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible. Tom Cruise certainly knows how to make a movie. In another universe Cruse could have been Iron Man and I always felt that his aggression with the Mission: Impossible franchise was his way of making up for that. That's probably why the dialog in this movie felt like Ethan Hawk was captain America or something and they are going up against a Bonafede supervillain in the form of an A. I system. As far as I'm concern the best villain of the franchise snice the late and great Phillip Seymour Huffman.The Avengers Assemble as franchise regulars Simon Pegg as Dunn and Ving Rhimes, who I say with glee, started this franchise with Cruse as Luther, make their return as IMF agents. Rebecca Ferguson reprises her role from the last movie and Haley Atwell is in the movie as well, but none of this makes me as happy as Ving still being in the franchise.The action sequences are so good in this picture. It was worth having to stay in me seat for almost three hours just so they can add a little more action in-between the Hero's journey dialogue.And this is just part one!? Part two has some big shoes to fill!\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: I love Tom Cruise movies, but this one feels pretty contrived. Beyond the plot, Grace was the biggest detriment to the movie. The character started out amusing but her shtick became insufferable and Ethan's infatuation idiotic. How they handled Ilsa feels both rushed and cheap, with no emotional weight felt. The biggest stunt was spoiled beforehand which I suppose did its job in getting me in the seat, but totally ruins the moment in film. The final act also lacked any tension and was honestly a little boring - there wasn't any real cleverness.Still, it was humorous throughout, had a good amount of charm and the production value is evident. That's enough for me to be above average but it's unlikely I'll watch the followup in theater.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: As a hardout Mission fan. I can confirm 5 years was definitely worth the wait. The film is extremally charming and filled with exciting humor, action and story-telling. Tom and Hayley really bring the film so much joy and create wonderful chemistry. The chase scene in Rome puts you on the edge of your seat and nothing prepares you for the daring things Tom and Hayley pull off in the train sequence.. Tom really understands the action genre and did not disappoint with this film. There is a perfect blend between foundation building for the story and the action sequences. The film is a beautiful set up to the part 2 coming next year.. Brilliant Watch 100/10.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Straight up Dead Reckoning Part 1 was fine. I think it's the weakest out of the last four instalments.I can't put my finger on one exact thing but it just felt a little underdone compared to the last few M:I and was expecting big things the whole movie. It was a combination of things like the acting felt a little weak I guess, the script was just fine, the action was decent but not great compared to other M:I and to the likes of John Wick that I'm now used to. The plot with the A. I is nothing new but it's always still interesting and especially at a time in the real world where the advancements seem to be heating up but the whole pickpocketing the key for 2 hours also got boring so fast. Too many cliches started piling up. The hand to hand combat was some of the weakest stuff I've seen it a while especially the Venice bridge scene, it looked awful, like I could see the choreography. The best scene for me was the desert storm at the start which really had my attention but everything after that seemed just average.I don't know if everyone else is now completely over their only trick being having someone go as someone else with these masks. It's so boring to me now and at a stage I'm kinda rolling my eyes. I really hope the machine blowing a fuse means we have seen the last of them.Tom Cruise is awesome with the stunts he does and will always have respect for the things him doing them but I really wish they didn't show the motorbike cliff jump scene in the trailer. What you see in the trailer is literally the whole stunt, don't get me wrong it's truly impressive but they showed the whole thing and just completely killed it for me.I'm slightly bummed with this one and just coming off seeing Indian Jones and having a lot more fun watching that. I don't care about runtimes but you have to have me sucked in and the whole time, I felt the time...People will love this movie but M:I may have fizzled out with me a bit after this one.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Greetings again from the darkness. The challenge in continuing the \"Mission: Impossible\" franchise is that fans expect each entry to be \"bigger\" and more awe-inspiring than the last. With the seventh film in the series, and the third straight he has directed, writer-director Christopher McQuarrie and superstar actor and daredevil Tom Cruise have managed to accomplish what seemed unlikely ... they have delivered Ethan Hunt's biggest and grandest mission yet. Prepare to be awed by the action.You should know that this is \"Part One\" and it runs 163 minutes, a full hour longer than most movies, and exponentially more expensive to produce. All this during an age when ultra-high-budget blockbusters are being rumored to be fading from public interest. Of course, we are only one year removed from Tom Cruise's TOP GUN: MAVERICK being credited with 'saving cinema', so stay on alert for a 'sky is falling' panic. McQuarrie co-wrote the script with Erik Jendresen (\"Band of Brothers\"), and they remain faithful to the characters and storylines established by the TV series creator, Bruce Geller.There may never have been an actor more suited to a recurring role than Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt (Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones might be the closest). The story itself is fairly straightforward, even if the item being chased often feels like a MacGuffin. Your questioning of how a 'simple' spy-thriller can be effective is understandable, yet it's fascinating to watch as Ethan Hunt's mission in life as an agent is evaluated, as is the cost he's paid as a man. Providing a contemporary theme, the obscure object of desire is an all-powerful key (actually two parts of a key) based on controlling an all-encompassing Artificial Intelligence (AI).In a twist on a familiar theme (and a classic comedy film), we have Airports, Trains, and EVs, the latter being a tiny Fiat with handcuffs. Still, the car chase is everything we might hope, while the high-tech facial search in the airport sequence delivers the thrills for techie viewers, and the train sparring occurs inside as well as on top. And lest you be worried, there are enough Cruise sprint scenes here to put CHARIOTS OF FIRE to shame.Familiar faces include Ethan Hunt's team of Luther (Ving Rhames, who along with Cruise, has appeared in all 7 MI films), Benji (Simon Pegg), and Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). It's nice to again see (and hear) Henry Czerny as Kittridge, Vanessa Kirby as arms dealer The White Widow, and Esai Morales - as Gabriel, the required villain in search of the same key as our good guys. New faces include Haylee Atwell as master pickpocket Grace, whose soul may or may not be beyond salvation; Cary Elwes as agency director Denlinger; Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis as officers after rogue Hunt; and Pom Klementieff as a hired assassin.The stunt work here is outstanding, and of course, Tom Cruise is renowned for personally handling many of the most breathtaking acts - the most memorable one here being his riding of a motorcycle off a cliff. This stunt has a 'making of' video that's been available for a while. As movie goers, we've never seen anything like it. This part one was originally scheduled for release in 2021 (thanks a lot, COVID), and now Part Two is set for 2024. It's been 27 years since the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE (1996) with Jon Voight ... Cruise was 34 in that one. This particular mission is the biggest yet, and it would certainly be impossible for the rest of us. It's a mission that will be closed out in Part Two, and simultaneously bring an end to Cruise's remarkable run as Ethan Hunt.Opening July 12, 2023.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: This movie started out promising but by the end, it just felt like being robbed of two and a half hours. I am a big fan of the MI movies (including MI2, which people seem to hate) and I could appreciate this movie for the few scenes that it did right, but it treats the audience like idiots in its bland, repetitive storyline (how many times do we need to hear the words \"the key\" and \"the entity\"? It was as if the writers of this movie just gave up on their jobs when they wrote this. Easily the weakest MI movie ever filmed. It had me staring at my watch every 20 minutes. As others have mentioned, the character development in this movie is also truly awful. I have barely any interest in seeing Part Two of Dead Reckoning at this point. The high scores this movie is getting absolutely baffle me. This movie by no means deserves a score higher than a 6 or a 6.5.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Basically, this movie is big, loud, and stupid.Definitely TOO loud, in fact. The music attempts to turn even the most minor scene into some sort of heart-pounding climax.There are endless ridiculous fights in which Tom Cruise is predictably unstoppable, no matter how many opponents he's up against. Slim girls get to beat up multiple men. (Emily Blunt was right when, commenting on a fight in \"Sicario\" in which, refreshingly, she loses to a bigger guy, she noted that Hollywood fight scenes in which 110-pound women whip larger males are \"so cheesy.\")The dull, tepid, way-too-pretty villain is, implausibly, a formidable fighter but sure doesn't look like one. An action movie is only as good as its villain is evil; this guy looks like a French fashion mogul.He and Cruise fight on top of -- wait for it -- a moving train! Haven't we seen that ridiculous sort of thing a hundred times before?The tediously overcomplicated plot makes it hard to keep track of who's on which side, nor do we care. Apparently, as is usual these days, we're supposed to root against the U. S. government.In all scenes involving conversations, virtually EVERY line is merely plot exposition in which characters tell us, in stilted dialogue, what's going on, what's supposed to happen, and how we're supposed to feel.The much-touted parachute jump is actually disappointing. It's over quite fast, and its main source of interest is that, if you've seen the promotional video, you know that Cruise himself actually made that jump.The only truly enjoyable sequence -- the cleverly worked-out rescue attempts on the falling train -- comes at the end, after nearly two and a half hours of empty cartoonish nonsense...Including, of course, an overlong cartoonish car chase, obligatory in dumb summer movies.\n",

It feels huge the whole time however I must say I while the set pieces were stellar, the hand to hand combat scenes were not great and a big step down from the last film (Fallout).Thebeginning is slow with a lot of expository being dumped (more than you'd usually see) but once it gets going it is pretty nonstop.This is a good chapter and Haley Atwell shines but it is nowhere near my favorite of the series.7/10Mi rankingsMi6 Fallout\n",

            "Skipping non-numeric rating: 'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part I (M:I7) is another strong entry in the action/spy series, with Ethan (Cruise) looking slightly older, but not less determined to save the world. I believe the sequel to this film will be his last outing - but we'll see. This time, there's some Skynet-like sentient-AI that's manipulating nefarious types to take over the world, so the IMF team are out to get the two halves of key that can stop it.Isla (Ferguson), Benji (Pegg) and Luther (Rhames) are back, as well as CIA boss Kittridge (Czerny), with Grace (Atwell), a thief, being the newcomer. The bad guys that keep thwarting them are Gabriel (Morales) from Ethan's past, and Paris (Klementieff). The consistency of having McQuarrie as director of the two previous films helps, with everything feeling assured and this working as a really solid follow-up to 'Fallout'.There's some funny moments, some sincere ones, and some of Ethan running, as contractually-obliged. The whole final scene on the train is excellent, with so many things happening, but there's plenty of good set-pieces throughout, including a good car chase. However, the piece-de-resistance is the motorbike off the cliff into a BASE jump is something else. The fact Cruise did it for real, multiple times, is crazy and inspiring.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Man.... I wish I loved this movie more than I did. Don't get me wrong, it's a solid action movie with jaw-dropping stunts (some of the best in the series), but as a Mission: Impossible movie, it felt like a small step backward for the franchise. Fallout had mind-blowing action sequences and stunt work, along with developing Ethan's relationship with Ilsa, providing closure with Julia, showing the lengths Ethan would go to protect those closest to him, and battling an imposing villain. Dead Reckoning: Part One stretches the movie across two films only to seemingly showcase action spectacle after action spectacle while sacrificing character development. Characters I have grown to love over a decade of films felt sidelined, ignored, or wasted. Hayley Atwell's new character chewed up most of the screen time, and while she was fantastic, I wanted to see more of the original team. The new villain had an inconsistent ability that confused more than intimidated. There were some important emotional moments that I just didn't feel the weight of when I definitely should have. Part Two might tie everything together and make me enjoy Part One more in retrospect, but unfortunately, I left wanting more from this one.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Just got out of seeing this movie. I am really disappointed that they totally killed off the potential relationship between Ethan and Ilsa. I am totally OK with her dying but the way that they did it and how anti-climactic it was after building up her character so much in the previous two films. Just seems like she would've deserved a better death than that. Also, what was the point of showing the two characters getting closer to each other, and in the last film, his ex-wife, basically giving them permission to move forward when you're just going to kill her off like that. Honestly, Rebecca Ferguson revised this franchise two movies ago and I think killing off her character was a big mistake. Even in the scenes that she's in it doesn't even seem like she's playing the same person. I wonder if they wrote her out of the movie because she's too busy with the rest of her work. Hayley Atwell's character doesn't make sense to me either. Just put her in the IMF because she can pick some pockets? This all seems forced. Maybe most won't agree, but I think this development totally ruined the movie for me.\n",

The sheer scale of this movie is epic, and with every twist and turn of the movie, you cannot help but marvel at the incredible sets used to bring this movie to life. Such a movie begs to be seen on the biggest screen possible where you can truly feel the grandeur of the film. Tom Cruise has once again delivered one of the best movies of the year, and I cannot recommend that you see it enough!\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: To me, a new M:I film is an event. From Part 4 onwards, they've been spectacular (all 10/10's).There's some good stuff here for sure, and overall it's a solid 8, but it's simply not as good as previous entries.I kept noticing that a lot of scenes had just 2 or 3 people in them, and I kept imagining the crew all masked up, as well as the cast when the camera wasn't on them. It can't be easy to make a huge movie like this during a pandemic, but it definitely shows.The A. I. plot is quite good, and Hunt's as-yet-unknown backstory quite intriguing, but the whole story basically revolves around: \"I've got the key, now she's got the key, now he's got the key\" etc. So much pick-pocketing.Also, I really wish they hadn't ruined the motorcycle jump in the promos. If you've seen the promo, you've seen the scene. There are really only 3 or 4 action sequences, and nothing we haven't really seen before. I actually enjoyed the first desert shoot-out the best.And- oh!- the exposition! There's a scene near the beginning that reminded me of a Neil Breen(!) movie, where powerful people sit in a room and just spout buzz words like \"nuclear war,\" \"economic collapse,\" \"dogs and cats living together\" etc.THAT said, it's still an 8/10. Tom always gives it his best, the rest of the cast is good (especially all four female leads) and I thought the added humour with Hunt's character was a nice touch. I'd rather watch this ten times over than any blatant cyncial Disney cash-grab.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Good God. I feel ashamed for approaching this film with a modicum of doubt that Tom would still be able to deliver. Unbelievably, this epic actually manages to top the brilliant Fallout. Tom is literally going to die if he keeps doing these stunts. The motorbike sequence is utterly ludicrous. Intriguing plot with actual stakes and some familiar faces ably supported by brilliant new allies and villains. Sets up Part II perfectly with a sensational finale that homages Back to the Future 3, MI:1 and Speed. It is funny, action packed, polished and exhilarating. Harrison was great last week, but Tom is still the King. 9/10.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: I was lucky to be able to watch this 4 days before its official release in Czech Republic as a pre-premiere (didn't know such a thing existed) and it was the first time I've felt real excitement to go watch a film at the cinema in ages thanks to the recent genius combination of Fallout and Top Gun 2.I know what they were trying to do with this film. Bringing Kittridge back and a convoluted train finale all harked back to the 1st movie that sparked it all off. Explaining that convoluted storyline along the way harks back to the criticisms made about that same first film.The sky jump stunt was an attempt to beat the stunts from Tom Cruise in previous installments that have now become a beloved trademark of the franchise.But this film unfortunately overall is most reminiscent of the second installment which was Tom Cruise centric and lacked any real impossible mission requiring teamwork, real stakes and ingenious problem solving.In fact, it could have even been intentional that this film reminds the viewer of Mission Impossible 2. The photos in the film of past Ethan Hunt when searching for present Ethan Hunt show him with his longer hair as he looked in that second film.Ultimately, I expected the story to be way better than what we get in this instalment.There are 2 guys that keep appearing at each scene trying to catch Ethan which seems a very cheap simple story.And the very simple plot is explained in long scenes to make it seem way more complicated that it actually is (people complained there should be more explanation in the first film, but at least the plot in the first film actually required brain power), and I have to say that some of the acting is quite poor at times, not helped by some rather cheesy lines in the script, including the lines and accents in the opening Russian submarine sequence.There is also not that much action. 3 main action sequences for a close to 3 hour movie, which are the desert shoot out at the beginning, the Venice car chase, and the train crash at the end.I thought the alleyway fight scene, which some have praised, was really quite subpar and not very enthralling.The best action scene is the Venice car chase because it is genuinely funny (yes, because it is excellently laugh out loud funny, but not in any way tense); I never had the feeling that I was on the edge of my seat.The motorcycle sky jump scene was a major disappointment after the hype because if you didn't know Cruise actually did do that stunt, they used so much CGI that people would just assume it was computer generated. It actually reminded me of Pierce Brosnan's riding the tsunami in Die Another Day (sorry Tom! The stunt is still awesome!).The same for the train at the end. I know they actually made that train, and probably actually threw it off a bridge, but it doesn't look real. Though it is a long action finale and very fun to watch, for me the lack of realism takes away any tension. You are enjoying it for its visual value, but again not feeling any 'wow' factor or tension.At the end of Fallout, for example, you really felt Ethan Hunt was battered, bruised, worn out and still fighting to save humanity. There is none of that.The most tragic thing about this movie is that, unlike in the best of the previous films, we're back to the team being irrelevant in this one. Benji and Luther don't actually do very much.And poor Ilsa. Fallout ended with Ethan's ex-wife essentially giving him permission to move on and be with Ilsa.The relationship between Ilsa and Hunt had been built up over two excellent movies - Rogue Nation and Fallout - and in this film she says almost nothing, looks grumpy and sad all the time, and dies in an anticlimactic fight that is literally spelt out to the audience as a way to replace her with newcomer Grace.Grace, played by Hayley Atwell, is good. A likeable character and a capable actress, but I don't get the story unless Rebecca Ferguson said she wants out the franchise.The film is all about chasing \"the key.\" No twists. No high stakes. There is virtually no grittiness in this outing. It feels very light.Ultimately I was hoping to enjoy a quality film in the franchise. A movie like Oblivion, Edge of Tomorrow, Fallout, Top Gun 2 or American Made that you can show to anyone and say these are recent really high quality films starring this guy called Tom Cruise.This is not one of those films.It is more like The Mummy. It is better than Mission Impossible 2 but not better than any of the others in the franchise.\n",

A 2 hour 43 minute adrenaline rush that contains some of the best action sequences put to film, embarrasses the majority of the competition out there and sets the stage for a magnificent part 2 whilst still being a satisfying adventure in its own right.This is possibly the most open and obvious a Mission film has been with its deeper meaning for cinema and what aspect of Cruise's career is being dissected this time with a film that focuses on Ethan's relationship with women and basically outright declares AI to be a soulless monster and how the human element is always needed (perfect film to release during a writer's strike).Tom Cruise is perfect as Ethan Hunt and the strongest aspect this time round is when the film explores what made Ethan who he is and reminds you he genuinely cares about his team but that comes at a cost. Physically, the madman is still going strong with his stunts, driving a bike off a cliff in truly breathtaking fashion.Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg and Rebecca Ferguson remain the best IMF team and all play to their strengths here. The longer this series goes on the more authentic their growing friendship feels. Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis get more than expected and their buddy cop antics are a lot of fun.With Esai Morales' charismatic yet terrifying Gabriel and Pom Klementieff's terrific henchman of few words, this franchise finally has more good villains than bad. The return of Henry Czerny as Kittridge is glorious and he remains as gleefully despicable as his first appearance.The best new addition is easily Hayley Atwell. She plays a type of character never seen before in these films which makes her character and dynamic with Cruise fresh in comparison to everyone who's come before and their chemistry is magnetic. Instantaneous from the second they interact.Christopher McQuarrie's direction is phenomenal. The action sequences are suitably practical (this is how you spend $290 million), and the camera gets as close to the action as humanly possible, he remains one of the best in the business working at this scale. There's plenty of canted angles as a nice homage to De Palma's original and it helps give this one its own style in comparison to McQuarrie's previous entries.The pacing is really impressive with the film feeling like it's in a perpetual third act from its first airport heist (which is so much fun). Lorne Balfe does the music once again and yet again it's a highlight of the film, he knows how to elevate everything so well and really hammers home the emotional beats.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Ethan Hunt has left the mere secret agent status and has ascended to the all living perfect messiah.There is so much wrong with this movie, which seriously pains me because I seriously love this series. The mission impossible movies have steadily become more convoluted and more stupidly written. This film reaches the peak of absurdity, feeling more like an over the top fast and furious movie. All foolish action, cheap parlor tricks to pull the heart strings (empty relationships), horrible writing, poor plot development.I mean seriously what ever happened to show don't tell?! This is becoming rather ridiculous.*convoluted villain dialogue*\n",
            "\"So what you're telling me is you plan to establish a new world order if you get that key and if someone stops you that would be bad?!\"Has Ethan Hunt suddenly become this vanilla James Bond? With the Bond girl cycling through every few films? Lazy writing. Not natural feeling. Forced. BlighIt pains me to give this so low.The truth is, this movie is mindless entertaining action. Tom Cruise delivers on some awesome stunts (seldom compared to other MI films). It's not horrible. It's fun entertainment, but a scour on the (in my opinion) reputable authentic feeling mission impossible series.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: So you probably watched IM 6 and said, they can't make it any better can they? Or Top Gun 2, guess again, this is an adrenaline action movie with a good story, well written, action scenes that just blow you away, not a boring moment and you are on the edge of your seat all the time, this is how you make movies! Tom Cruise did it again, WOW!! It's an exhausting ride he takes you on, man I forgot to eat my popcorn and by the time i finally wanted some my wife had eaten all of it, but hey I was so immersed into the movie that time stood still and i forgot everything around me.Go and see it, this one gets my full recommendation, the only reason it's not a 10 is due to the fact it's not a completely new type of movie, however this one is done as a good action movie should be made, i don't see how they could have made it better, I really can't, go watch it and have a good time while you do it, it will put a big smile on your face that's for sure.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Am huge fan of MI franchise. The best part about all MI movies were how they plan and pull off an impossible mission. Thus I am quite disappointed on how this mission never seemed too difficult , let alone impossible.Action was okay. Car chase was funny, but not exciting. Jumping off the cliff seemed forced to me. Why would you keep driving uphill when you can take short cuts to reach the train. It wasn't even a fast train. The key kept being stolen from pockets too many times which makes you wonder how lazy the scripting was. Kill old gf to make new gf was also lazy writing.Unlike other MIs, Ethan had no single smart move or plan. It felt more like let's go and see what happens.Am not sure how MI fans ignored all these weaknesses and gave this film 8+ rating.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: This was a great movie. However, it lost a star from me for making the audience believe Ilsa is dead. They've spent two films building up Ilsa as being Ethan's equal, and hinted at an eventual romance. She's been able to fight off multiple men bare-handed yet she meets her demise by one guy when she has a sword? Then they brush past her death like it means nothing, only for her to be replaced by a new woman. I thought it was a huge disservice to the character.I know Rebecca Ferguson is very busy so she might have asked to leave, but I'm hoping this isn't the end for my favorite character in these films. She deserves a happy ending, or at least a better death than the one she received in this movie. It really took me out of the rest of the film. Hopefully, we'll see her again in Part Two.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Remember that classic MI scene where they broke in at CIA, and Cruise was hanging from the ceiling using wires? It's not a huge setpiece, but that scene is a nailbiting example of ingenious problem solving.In 'Dead Reckoning' there's none of that. Here it's keys changing hands every 10 minutes that is suppose to pass as suspense. And of course the only true selling point: the stunts performed by Tom Cruise.But I want and expect more than that.A large part of the film is devoted to people sitting or standing in a room, explaining what the plot is. Endless talking and explaining. We are told in several scenes the same information we just heard. Worst one is Benji, who is merely there to repeat things for someone in the cast, to make sure everyone in the audience knows what is going on. That is sloppy writing. One of the biggest no-no's as a screenwriter is resolving to \"so what you are saying is, that...\" info sharing. Benji does this all the time. And he is as incompetent as usual. And he is supposed to be a part of a small and unique team that is saving the world? Really?I hope MI:8 isn't just another Tom Cruise stunt reel where it looks like they make the story up as the go along, as long as all marks are checked in the end (running, face swapping, dealing with heights etc), and where character development takes a backseat. Bigger is not always better. And the action ALWAYS has to serve the story, not the other way around.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: After the first 30 minutes that promised an intellectual action thriller, the film starts its nosedive into mediocrity by introducing a thief who constantly indulges in disloyalty, for petty gains, towards the IMF and Hunt, but is held in high regards by Hunt. For the life of me, I couldn't understand why. The film also doesn't bother with it.Neither is it concerned with the so called action set pieces. _Fallout_ had plethora of those, one after the other, tied together by a cogent story line. For all its hype, it has 2-3 in a run time of close to 160 minutes, which tested my patience.Reading it's critics' reviews post viewing make me feel as if they have been written by the Entity, the AI behemoth at the center of this. The perceived entertainment value implied by them is not even remotely connected with the reality.It is no wonder that it is faltering at the US box office. It is no Top Gun- Maverick. Crowds are going to turn up, especially outside the US, because of Cruise's star power. But I don't believe this will please most of them.Disappointing.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: An absolute masterclass in producing an enjoyable action movie. Cinematography was great, the story was paced extremely well, and the casting of ALL roles was absolutely perfect.Cruise, Pegg and Rhames were awesome as always, Whigham and Davis were great additions, but the power quartet of Ferguson, Atwell, Klementieff and Kirby, really went above and beyond in making this movie perfect. Not to mention the chilling confidence of Morales as Gabriel, who practically oozes tangible danger.From the pre-opening credits scene to the final act, if you're like me, you will be on the edge of your seat - especially during any fight scene that involves Ferguson or Klementieff - and whilst there are moments that the tempo slows down to advance the story, it is always completely captivating.The single, solitary, disappointment comes as the credits roll, and you remember you're going to have to wait until next year to see how it ends.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Absolutely superb! Was hoping they could do the impossible and surpass Fallout! And Cruise, McQuarrie and co have accomplished this in spades, delivering the best spy/ action thriller in years.It is a next level masterclass of a film, with everything you would expect from an Mission Impossible film and more.The cast are great, with the new additions adding so much to the usual MI crew. The stunts are performed to the usual high standard and give you that Wow feeling you want, The story is fantastic, leaving you wanting more, setting up Part Two really wellGo see this on the best screen possible.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: It should be impossible to fumble the bag so badly on a nostalgia trip movie like this. Just let Tom Cruise run, do some crazy stunts and play the iconic theme music. But no they gotta drag on for three hours with a meaningless storyline just for it to be one part of an incomplete movie. Like whatever happened to movie editing? There's no reason for this movie to be this long and a lot of the content is completely unnecessary to move the plot forward. I don't expect MI movies to have watertight logic but then atleast the writers shouldn't twist themselves into knots thinking they're making a deeper movie than they are, the sooner these movie trends with AI, quantum space tunneling, multiverse nonsense end the better it is for good storylines.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: This latest Mission: Impossible movie is a slam dunk that needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible. Tom Cruise certainly knows how to make a movie. In another universe Cruse could have been Iron Man and I always felt that his aggression with the Mission: Impossible franchise was his way of making up for that. That's probably why the dialog in this movie felt like Ethan Hawk was captain America or something and they are going up against a Bonafede supervillain in the form of an A. I system. As far as I'm concern the best villain of the franchise snice the late and great Phillip Seymour Huffman.The Avengers Assemble as franchise regulars Simon Pegg as Dunn and Ving Rhimes, who I say with glee, started this franchise with Cruse as Luther, make their return as IMF agents. Rebecca Ferguson reprises her role from the last movie and Haley Atwell is in the movie as well, but none of this makes me as happy as Ving still being in the franchise.The action sequences are so good in this picture. It was worth having to stay in me seat for almost three hours just so they can add a little more action in-between the Hero's journey dialogue.And this is just part one!? Part two has some big shoes to fill!\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: I love Tom Cruise movies, but this one feels pretty contrived. Beyond the plot, Grace was the biggest detriment to the movie. The character started out amusing but her shtick became insufferable and Ethan's infatuation idiotic. How they handled Ilsa feels both rushed and cheap, with no emotional weight felt. The biggest stunt was spoiled beforehand which I suppose did its job in getting me in the seat, but totally ruins the moment in film. The final act also lacked any tension and was honestly a little boring - there wasn't any real cleverness.Still, it was humorous throughout, had a good amount of charm and the production value is evident. That's enough for me to be above average but it's unlikely I'll watch the followup in theater.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: As a hardout Mission fan. I can confirm 5 years was definitely worth the wait. The film is extremally charming and filled with exciting humor, action and story-telling. Tom and Hayley really bring the film so much joy and create wonderful chemistry. The chase scene in Rome puts you on the edge of your seat and nothing prepares you for the daring things Tom and Hayley pull off in the train sequence.. Tom really understands the action genre and did not disappoint with this film. There is a perfect blend between foundation building for the story and the action sequences. The film is a beautiful set up to the part 2 coming next year.. Brilliant Watch 100/10.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Straight up Dead Reckoning Part 1 was fine. I think it's the weakest out of the last four instalments.I can't put my finger on one exact thing but it just felt a little underdone compared to the last few M:I and was expecting big things the whole movie. It was a combination of things like the acting felt a little weak I guess, the script was just fine, the action was decent but not great compared to other M:I and to the likes of John Wick that I'm now used to. The plot with the A. I is nothing new but it's always still interesting and especially at a time in the real world where the advancements seem to be heating up but the whole pickpocketing the key for 2 hours also got boring so fast. Too many cliches started piling up. The hand to hand combat was some of the weakest stuff I've seen it a while especially the Venice bridge scene, it looked awful, like I could see the choreography. The best scene for me was the desert storm at the start which really had my attention but everything after that seemed just average.I don't know if everyone else is now completely over their only trick being having someone go as someone else with these masks. It's so boring to me now and at a stage I'm kinda rolling my eyes. I really hope the machine blowing a fuse means we have seen the last of them.Tom Cruise is awesome with the stunts he does and will always have respect for the things him doing them but I really wish they didn't show the motorbike cliff jump scene in the trailer. What you see in the trailer is literally the whole stunt, don't get me wrong it's truly impressive but they showed the whole thing and just completely killed it for me.I'm slightly bummed with this one and just coming off seeing Indian Jones and having a lot more fun watching that. I don't care about runtimes but you have to have me sucked in and the whole time, I felt the time...People will love this movie but M:I may have fizzled out with me a bit after this one.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Greetings again from the darkness. The challenge in continuing the \"Mission: Impossible\" franchise is that fans expect each entry to be \"bigger\" and more awe-inspiring than the last. With the seventh film in the series, and the third straight he has directed, writer-director Christopher McQuarrie and superstar actor and daredevil Tom Cruise have managed to accomplish what seemed unlikely ... they have delivered Ethan Hunt's biggest and grandest mission yet. Prepare to be awed by the action.You should know that this is \"Part One\" and it runs 163 minutes, a full hour longer than most movies, and exponentially more expensive to produce. All this during an age when ultra-high-budget blockbusters are being rumored to be fading from public interest. Of course, we are only one year removed from Tom Cruise's TOP GUN: MAVERICK being credited with 'saving cinema', so stay on alert for a 'sky is falling' panic. McQuarrie co-wrote the script with Erik Jendresen (\"Band of Brothers\"), and they remain faithful to the characters and storylines established by the TV series creator, Bruce Geller.There may never have been an actor more suited to a recurring role than Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt (Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones might be the closest). The story itself is fairly straightforward, even if the item being chased often feels like a MacGuffin. Your questioning of how a 'simple' spy-thriller can be effective is understandable, yet it's fascinating to watch as Ethan Hunt's mission in life as an agent is evaluated, as is the cost he's paid as a man. Providing a contemporary theme, the obscure object of desire is an all-powerful key (actually two parts of a key) based on controlling an all-encompassing Artificial Intelligence (AI).In a twist on a familiar theme (and a classic comedy film), we have Airports, Trains, and EVs, the latter being a tiny Fiat with handcuffs. Still, the car chase is everything we might hope, while the high-tech facial search in the airport sequence delivers the thrills for techie viewers, and the train sparring occurs inside as well as on top. And lest you be worried, there are enough Cruise sprint scenes here to put CHARIOTS OF FIRE to shame.Familiar faces include Ethan Hunt's team of Luther (Ving Rhames, who along with Cruise, has appeared in all 7 MI films), Benji (Simon Pegg), and Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). It's nice to again see (and hear) Henry Czerny as Kittridge, Vanessa Kirby as arms dealer The White Widow, and Esai Morales - as Gabriel, the required villain in search of the same key as our good guys. New faces include Haylee Atwell as master pickpocket Grace, whose soul may or may not be beyond salvation; Cary Elwes as agency director Denlinger; Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis as officers after rogue Hunt; and Pom Klementieff as a hired assassin.The stunt work here is outstanding, and of course, Tom Cruise is renowned for personally handling many of the most breathtaking acts - the most memorable one here being his riding of a motorcycle off a cliff. This stunt has a 'making of' video that's been available for a while. As movie goers, we've never seen anything like it. This part one was originally scheduled for release in 2021 (thanks a lot, COVID), and now Part Two is set for 2024. It's been 27 years since the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE (1996) with Jon Voight ... Cruise was 34 in that one. This particular mission is the biggest yet, and it would certainly be impossible for the rest of us. It's a mission that will be closed out in Part Two, and simultaneously bring an end to Cruise's remarkable run as Ethan Hunt.Opening July 12, 2023.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: This movie started out promising but by the end, it just felt like being robbed of two and a half hours. I am a big fan of the MI movies (including MI2, which people seem to hate) and I could appreciate this movie for the few scenes that it did right, but it treats the audience like idiots in its bland, repetitive storyline (how many times do we need to hear the words \"the key\" and \"the entity\"? It was as if the writers of this movie just gave up on their jobs when they wrote this. Easily the weakest MI movie ever filmed. It had me staring at my watch every 20 minutes. As others have mentioned, the character development in this movie is also truly awful. I have barely any interest in seeing Part Two of Dead Reckoning at this point. The high scores this movie is getting absolutely baffle me. This movie by no means deserves a score higher than a 6 or a 6.5.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Basically, this movie is big, loud, and stupid.Definitely TOO loud, in fact. The music attempts to turn even the most minor scene into some sort of heart-pounding climax.There are endless ridiculous fights in which Tom Cruise is predictably unstoppable, no matter how many opponents he's up against. Slim girls get to beat up multiple men. (Emily Blunt was right when, commenting on a fight in \"Sicario\" in which, refreshingly, she loses to a bigger guy, she noted that Hollywood fight scenes in which 110-pound women whip larger males are \"so cheesy.\")The dull, tepid, way-too-pretty villain is, implausibly, a formidable fighter but sure doesn't look like one. An action movie is only as good as its villain is evil; this guy looks like a French fashion mogul.He and Cruise fight on top of -- wait for it -- a moving train! Haven't we seen that ridiculous sort of thing a hundred times before?The tediously overcomplicated plot makes it hard to keep track of who's on which side, nor do we care. Apparently, as is usual these days, we're supposed to root against the U. S. government.In all scenes involving conversations, virtually EVERY line is merely plot exposition in which characters tell us, in stilted dialogue, what's going on, what's supposed to happen, and how we're supposed to feel.The much-touted parachute jump is actually disappointing. It's over quite fast, and its main source of interest is that, if you've seen the promotional video, you know that Cruise himself actually made that jump.The only truly enjoyable sequence -- the cleverly worked-out rescue attempts on the falling train -- comes at the end, after nearly two and a half hours of empty cartoonish nonsense...Including, of course, an overlong cartoonish car chase, obligatory in dumb summer movies.\n",

It feels huge the whole time however I must say I while the set pieces were stellar, the hand to hand combat scenes were not great and a big step down from the last film (Fallout).Thebeginning is slow with a lot of expository being dumped (more than you'd usually see) but once it gets going it is pretty nonstop.This is a good chapter and Haley Atwell shines but it is nowhere near my favorite of the series.7/10Mi rankingsMi6 Fallout\n",

            "Skipping non-numeric rating: 'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part I (M:I7) is another strong entry in the action/spy series, with Ethan (Cruise) looking slightly older, but not less determined to save the world. I believe the sequel to this film will be his last outing - but we'll see. This time, there's some Skynet-like sentient-AI that's manipulating nefarious types to take over the world, so the IMF team are out to get the two halves of key that can stop it.Isla (Ferguson), Benji (Pegg) and Luther (Rhames) are back, as well as CIA boss Kittridge (Czerny), with Grace (Atwell), a thief, being the newcomer. The bad guys that keep thwarting them are Gabriel (Morales) from Ethan's past, and Paris (Klementieff). The consistency of having McQuarrie as director of the two previous films helps, with everything feeling assured and this working as a really solid follow-up to 'Fallout'.There's some funny moments, some sincere ones, and some of Ethan running, as contractually-obliged. The whole final scene on the train is excellent, with so many things happening, but there's plenty of good set-pieces throughout, including a good car chase. However, the piece-de-resistance is the motorbike off the cliff into a BASE jump is something else. The fact Cruise did it for real, multiple times, is crazy and inspiring.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Man.... I wish I loved this movie more than I did. Don't get me wrong, it's a solid action movie with jaw-dropping stunts (some of the best in the series), but as a Mission: Impossible movie, it felt like a small step backward for the franchise. Fallout had mind-blowing action sequences and stunt work, along with developing Ethan's relationship with Ilsa, providing closure with Julia, showing the lengths Ethan would go to protect those closest to him, and battling an imposing villain. Dead Reckoning: Part One stretches the movie across two films only to seemingly showcase action spectacle after action spectacle while sacrificing character development. Characters I have grown to love over a decade of films felt sidelined, ignored, or wasted. Hayley Atwell's new character chewed up most of the screen time, and while she was fantastic, I wanted to see more of the original team. The new villain had an inconsistent ability that confused more than intimidated. There were some important emotional moments that I just didn't feel the weight of when I definitely should have. Part Two might tie everything together and make me enjoy Part One more in retrospect, but unfortunately, I left wanting more from this one.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Just got out of seeing this movie. I am really disappointed that they totally killed off the potential relationship between Ethan and Ilsa. I am totally OK with her dying but the way that they did it and how anti-climactic it was after building up her character so much in the previous two films. Just seems like she would've deserved a better death than that. Also, what was the point of showing the two characters getting closer to each other, and in the last film, his ex-wife, basically giving them permission to move forward when you're just going to kill her off like that. Honestly, Rebecca Ferguson revised this franchise two movies ago and I think killing off her character was a big mistake. Even in the scenes that she's in it doesn't even seem like she's playing the same person. I wonder if they wrote her out of the movie because she's too busy with the rest of her work. Hayley Atwell's character doesn't make sense to me either. Just put her in the IMF because she can pick some pockets? This all seems forced. Maybe most won't agree, but I think this development totally ruined the movie for me.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Just saw this one in a theatre, and boy... what an adrenaline rush it is. The latest Mission Impossible features some of the most incredible stunts ever put to camera. The story is absolutely exhilarating and continues to bring new life to a veteran movie franchise. The sheer scale of this movie is epic, and with every twist and turn of the movie, you cannot help but marvel at the incredible sets used to bring this movie to life. Such a movie begs to be seen on the biggest screen possible where you can truly feel the grandeur of the film. Tom Cruise has once again delivered one of the best movies of the year, and I cannot recommend that you see it enough!\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: To me, a new M:I film is an event. From Part 4 onwards, they've been spectacular (all 10/10's).There's some good stuff here for sure, and overall it's a solid 8, but it's simply not as good as previous entries.I kept noticing that a lot of scenes had just 2 or 3 people in them, and I kept imagining the crew all masked up, as well as the cast when the camera wasn't on them. It can't be easy to make a huge movie like this during a pandemic, but it definitely shows.The A. I. plot is quite good, and Hunt's as-yet-unknown backstory quite intriguing, but the whole story basically revolves around: \"I've got the key, now she's got the key, now he's got the key\" etc. So much pick-pocketing.Also, I really wish they hadn't ruined the motorcycle jump in the promos. If you've seen the promo, you've seen the scene. There are really only 3 or 4 action sequences, and nothing we haven't really seen before. I actually enjoyed the first desert shoot-out the best.And- oh!- the exposition! There's a scene near the beginning that reminded me of a Neil Breen(!) movie, where powerful people sit in a room and just spout buzz words like \"nuclear war,\" \"economic collapse,\" \"dogs and cats living together\" etc.THAT said, it's still an 8/10. Tom always gives it his best, the rest of the cast is good (especially all four female leads) and I thought the added humour with Hunt's character was a nice touch. I'd rather watch this ten times over than any blatant cyncial Disney cash-grab.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Good God. I feel ashamed for approaching this film with a modicum of doubt that Tom would still be able to deliver. Unbelievably, this epic actually manages to top the brilliant Fallout. Tom is literally going to die if he keeps doing these stunts. The motorbike sequence is utterly ludicrous. Intriguing plot with actual stakes and some familiar faces ably supported by brilliant new allies and villains. Sets up Part II perfectly with a sensational finale that homages Back to the Future 3, MI:1 and Speed. It is funny, action packed, polished and exhilarating. Harrison was great last week, but Tom is still the King. 9/10.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: I was lucky to be able to watch this 4 days before its official release in Czech Republic as a pre-premiere (didn't know such a thing existed) and it was the first time I've felt real excitement to go watch a film at the cinema in ages thanks to the recent genius combination of Fallout and Top Gun 2.I know what they were trying to do with this film. Bringing Kittridge back and a convoluted train finale all harked back to the 1st movie that sparked it all off. Explaining that convoluted storyline along the way harks back to the criticisms made about that same first film.The sky jump stunt was an attempt to beat the stunts from Tom Cruise in previous installments that have now become a beloved trademark of the franchise.But this film unfortunately overall is most reminiscent of the second installment which was Tom Cruise centric and lacked any real impossible mission requiring teamwork, real stakes and ingenious problem solving.In fact, it could have even been intentional that this film reminds the viewer of Mission Impossible 2. The photos in the film of past Ethan Hunt when searching for present Ethan Hunt show him with his longer hair as he looked in that second film.Ultimately, I expected the story to be way better than what we get in this instalment.There are 2 guys that keep appearing at each scene trying to catch Ethan which seems a very cheap simple story.And the very simple plot is explained in long scenes to make it seem way more complicated that it actually is (people complained there should be more explanation in the first film, but at least the plot in the first film actually required brain power), and I have to say that some of the acting is quite poor at times, not helped by some rather cheesy lines in the script, including the lines and accents in the opening Russian submarine sequence.There is also not that much action. 3 main action sequences for a close to 3 hour movie, which are the desert shoot out at the beginning, the Venice car chase, and the train crash at the end.I thought the alleyway fight scene, which some have praised, was really quite subpar and not very enthralling.The best action scene is the Venice car chase because it is genuinely funny (yes, because it is excellently laugh out loud funny, but not in any way tense); I never had the feeling that I was on the edge of my seat.The motorcycle sky jump scene was a major disappointment after the hype because if you didn't know Cruise actually did do that stunt, they used so much CGI that people would just assume it was computer generated. It actually reminded me of Pierce Brosnan's riding the tsunami in Die Another Day (sorry Tom! The stunt is still awesome!).The same for the train at the end. I know they actually made that train, and probably actually threw it off a bridge, but it doesn't look real. Though it is a long action finale and very fun to watch, for me the lack of realism takes away any tension. You are enjoying it for its visual value, but again not feeling any 'wow' factor or tension.At the end of Fallout, for example, you really felt Ethan Hunt was battered, bruised, worn out and still fighting to save humanity. There is none of that.The most tragic thing about this movie is that, unlike in the best of the previous films, we're back to the team being irrelevant in this one. Benji and Luther don't actually do very much.And poor Ilsa. Fallout ended with Ethan's ex-wife essentially giving him permission to move on and be with Ilsa.The relationship between Ilsa and Hunt had been built up over two excellent movies - Rogue Nation and Fallout - and in this film she says almost nothing, looks grumpy and sad all the time, and dies in an anticlimactic fight that is literally spelt out to the audience as a way to replace her with newcomer Grace.Grace, played by Hayley Atwell, is good. A likeable character and a capable actress, but I don't get the story unless Rebecca Ferguson said she wants out the franchise.The film is all about chasing \"the key.\" No twists. No high stakes. There is virtually no grittiness in this outing. It feels very light.Ultimately I was hoping to enjoy a quality film in the franchise. A movie like Oblivion, Edge of Tomorrow, Fallout, Top Gun 2 or American Made that you can show to anyone and say these are recent really high quality films starring this guy called Tom Cruise.This is not one of those films.It is more like The Mummy. It is better than Mission Impossible 2 but not better than any of the others in the franchise.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One confirms that Mission Impossible is the best franchise currently going and possibly ever made. A 2 hour 43 minute adrenaline rush that contains some of the best action sequences put to film, embarrasses the majority of the competition out there and sets the stage for a magnificent part 2 whilst still being a satisfying adventure in its own right.This is possibly the most open and obvious a Mission film has been with its deeper meaning for cinema and what aspect of Cruise's career is being dissected this time with a film that focuses on Ethan's relationship with women and basically outright declares AI to be a soulless monster and how the human element is always needed (perfect film to release during a writer's strike).Tom Cruise is perfect as Ethan Hunt and the strongest aspect this time round is when the film explores what made Ethan who he is and reminds you he genuinely cares about his team but that comes at a cost. Physically, the madman is still going strong with his stunts, driving a bike off a cliff in truly breathtaking fashion.Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg and Rebecca Ferguson remain the best IMF team and all play to their strengths here. The longer this series goes on the more authentic their growing friendship feels. Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis get more than expected and their buddy cop antics are a lot of fun.With Esai Morales' charismatic yet terrifying Gabriel and Pom Klementieff's terrific henchman of few words, this franchise finally has more good villains than bad. The return of Henry Czerny as Kittridge is glorious and he remains as gleefully despicable as his first appearance.The best new addition is easily Hayley Atwell. She plays a type of character never seen before in these films which makes her character and dynamic with Cruise fresh in comparison to everyone who's come before and their chemistry is magnetic. Instantaneous from the second they interact.Christopher McQuarrie's direction is phenomenal. The action sequences are suitably practical (this is how you spend $290 million), and the camera gets as close to the action as humanly possible, he remains one of the best in the business working at this scale. There's plenty of canted angles as a nice homage to De Palma's original and it helps give this one its own style in comparison to McQuarrie's previous entries.The pacing is really impressive with the film feeling like it's in a perpetual third act from its first airport heist (which is so much fun). Lorne Balfe does the music once again and yet again it's a highlight of the film, he knows how to elevate everything so well and really hammers home the emotional beats.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Ethan Hunt has left the mere secret agent status and has ascended to the all living perfect messiah.There is so much wrong with this movie, which seriously pains me because I seriously love this series. The mission impossible movies have steadily become more convoluted and more stupidly written. This film reaches the peak of absurdity, feeling more like an over the top fast and furious movie. All foolish action, cheap parlor tricks to pull the heart strings (empty relationships), horrible writing, poor plot development.I mean seriously what ever happened to show don't tell?! This is becoming rather ridiculous.*convoluted villain dialogue*\n",
            "\"So what you're telling me is you plan to establish a new world order if you get that key and if someone stops you that would be bad?!\"Has Ethan Hunt suddenly become this vanilla James Bond? With the Bond girl cycling through every few films? Lazy writing. Not natural feeling. Forced. BlighIt pains me to give this so low.The truth is, this movie is mindless entertaining action. Tom Cruise delivers on some awesome stunts (seldom compared to other MI films). It's not horrible. It's fun entertainment, but a scour on the (in my opinion) reputable authentic feeling mission impossible series.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: So you probably watched IM 6 and said, they can't make it any better can they? Or Top Gun 2, guess again, this is an adrenaline action movie with a good story, well written, action scenes that just blow you away, not a boring moment and you are on the edge of your seat all the time, this is how you make movies! Tom Cruise did it again, WOW!! It's an exhausting ride he takes you on, man I forgot to eat my popcorn and by the time i finally wanted some my wife had eaten all of it, but hey I was so immersed into the movie that time stood still and i forgot everything around me.Go and see it, this one gets my full recommendation, the only reason it's not a 10 is due to the fact it's not a completely new type of movie, however this one is done as a good action movie should be made, i don't see how they could have made it better, I really can't, go watch it and have a good time while you do it, it will put a big smile on your face that's for sure.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Am huge fan of MI franchise. The best part about all MI movies were how they plan and pull off an impossible mission. Thus I am quite disappointed on how this mission never seemed too difficult , let alone impossible.Action was okay. Car chase was funny, but not exciting. Jumping off the cliff seemed forced to me. Why would you keep driving uphill when you can take short cuts to reach the train. It wasn't even a fast train. The key kept being stolen from pockets too many times which makes you wonder how lazy the scripting was. Kill old gf to make new gf was also lazy writing.Unlike other MIs, Ethan had no single smart move or plan. It felt more like let's go and see what happens.Am not sure how MI fans ignored all these weaknesses and gave this film 8+ rating.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: This was a great movie. However, it lost a star from me for making the audience believe Ilsa is dead. They've spent two films building up Ilsa as being Ethan's equal, and hinted at an eventual romance. She's been able to fight off multiple men bare-handed yet she meets her demise by one guy when she has a sword? Then they brush past her death like it means nothing, only for her to be replaced by a new woman. I thought it was a huge disservice to the character.I know Rebecca Ferguson is very busy so she might have asked to leave, but I'm hoping this isn't the end for my favorite character in these films. She deserves a happy ending, or at least a better death than the one she received in this movie. It really took me out of the rest of the film. Hopefully, we'll see her again in Part Two.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Remember that classic MI scene where they broke in at CIA, and Cruise was hanging from the ceiling using wires? It's not a huge setpiece, but that scene is a nailbiting example of ingenious problem solving.In 'Dead Reckoning' there's none of that. Here it's keys changing hands every 10 minutes that is suppose to pass as suspense. And of course the only true selling point: the stunts performed by Tom Cruise.But I want and expect more than that.A large part of the film is devoted to people sitting or standing in a room, explaining what the plot is. Endless talking and explaining. We are told in several scenes the same information we just heard. Worst one is Benji, who is merely there to repeat things for someone in the cast, to make sure everyone in the audience knows what is going on. That is sloppy writing. One of the biggest no-no's as a screenwriter is resolving to \"so what you are saying is, that...\" info sharing. Benji does this all the time. And he is as incompetent as usual. And he is supposed to be a part of a small and unique team that is saving the world? Really?I hope MI:8 isn't just another Tom Cruise stunt reel where it looks like they make the story up as the go along, as long as all marks are checked in the end (running, face swapping, dealing with heights etc), and where character development takes a backseat. Bigger is not always better. And the action ALWAYS has to serve the story, not the other way around.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: After the first 30 minutes that promised an intellectual action thriller, the film starts its nosedive into mediocrity by introducing a thief who constantly indulges in disloyalty, for petty gains, towards the IMF and Hunt, but is held in high regards by Hunt. For the life of me, I couldn't understand why. The film also doesn't bother with it.Neither is it concerned with the so called action set pieces. _Fallout_ had plethora of those, one after the other, tied together by a cogent story line. For all its hype, it has 2-3 in a run time of close to 160 minutes, which tested my patience.Reading it's critics' reviews post viewing make me feel as if they have been written by the Entity, the AI behemoth at the center of this. The perceived entertainment value implied by them is not even remotely connected with the reality.It is no wonder that it is faltering at the US box office. It is no Top Gun- Maverick. Crowds are going to turn up, especially outside the US, because of Cruise's star power. But I don't believe this will please most of them.Disappointing.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: An absolute masterclass in producing an enjoyable action movie. Cinematography was great, the story was paced extremely well, and the casting of ALL roles was absolutely perfect.Cruise, Pegg and Rhames were awesome as always, Whigham and Davis were great additions, but the power quartet of Ferguson, Atwell, Klementieff and Kirby, really went above and beyond in making this movie perfect. Not to mention the chilling confidence of Morales as Gabriel, who practically oozes tangible danger.From the pre-opening credits scene to the final act, if you're like me, you will be on the edge of your seat - especially during any fight scene that involves Ferguson or Klementieff - and whilst there are moments that the tempo slows down to advance the story, it is always completely captivating.The single, solitary, disappointment comes as the credits roll, and you remember you're going to have to wait until next year to see how it ends.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Absolutely superb! Was hoping they could do the impossible and surpass Fallout! And Cruise, McQuarrie and co have accomplished this in spades, delivering the best spy/ action thriller in years.It is a next level masterclass of a film, with everything you would expect from an Mission Impossible film and more.The cast are great, with the new additions adding so much to the usual MI crew. The stunts are performed to the usual high standard and give you that Wow feeling you want, The story is fantastic, leaving you wanting more, setting up Part Two really wellGo see this on the best screen possible.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: It should be impossible to fumble the bag so badly on a nostalgia trip movie like this. Just let Tom Cruise run, do some crazy stunts and play the iconic theme music. But no they gotta drag on for three hours with a meaningless storyline just for it to be one part of an incomplete movie. Like whatever happened to movie editing? There's no reason for this movie to be this long and a lot of the content is completely unnecessary to move the plot forward. I don't expect MI movies to have watertight logic but then atleast the writers shouldn't twist themselves into knots thinking they're making a deeper movie than they are, the sooner these movie trends with AI, quantum space tunneling, multiverse nonsense end the better it is for good storylines.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: This latest Mission: Impossible movie is a slam dunk that needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible. Tom Cruise certainly knows how to make a movie. In another universe Cruse could have been Iron Man and I always felt that his aggression with the Mission: Impossible franchise was his way of making up for that. That's probably why the dialog in this movie felt like Ethan Hawk was captain America or something and they are going up against a Bonafede supervillain in the form of an A. I system. As far as I'm concern the best villain of the franchise snice the late and great Phillip Seymour Huffman.The Avengers Assemble as franchise regulars Simon Pegg as Dunn and Ving Rhimes, who I say with glee, started this franchise with Cruse as Luther, make their return as IMF agents. Rebecca Ferguson reprises her role from the last movie and Haley Atwell is in the movie as well, but none of this makes me as happy as Ving still being in the franchise.The action sequences are so good in this picture. It was worth having to stay in me seat for almost three hours just so they can add a little more action in-between the Hero's journey dialogue.And this is just part one!? Part two has some big shoes to fill!\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: I love Tom Cruise movies, but this one feels pretty contrived. Beyond the plot, Grace was the biggest detriment to the movie. The character started out amusing but her shtick became insufferable and Ethan's infatuation idiotic. How they handled Ilsa feels both rushed and cheap, with no emotional weight felt. The biggest stunt was spoiled beforehand which I suppose did its job in getting me in the seat, but totally ruins the moment in film. The final act also lacked any tension and was honestly a little boring - there wasn't any real cleverness.Still, it was humorous throughout, had a good amount of charm and the production value is evident. That's enough for me to be above average but it's unlikely I'll watch the followup in theater.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: As a hardout Mission fan. I can confirm 5 years was definitely worth the wait. The film is extremally charming and filled with exciting humor, action and story-telling. Tom and Hayley really bring the film so much joy and create wonderful chemistry. The chase scene in Rome puts you on the edge of your seat and nothing prepares you for the daring things Tom and Hayley pull off in the train sequence.. Tom really understands the action genre and did not disappoint with this film. There is a perfect blend between foundation building for the story and the action sequences. The film is a beautiful set up to the part 2 coming next year.. Brilliant Watch 100/10.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Straight up Dead Reckoning Part 1 was fine. I think it's the weakest out of the last four instalments.I can't put my finger on one exact thing but it just felt a little underdone compared to the last few M:I and was expecting big things the whole movie. It was a combination of things like the acting felt a little weak I guess, the script was just fine, the action was decent but not great compared to other M:I and to the likes of John Wick that I'm now used to. The plot with the A. I is nothing new but it's always still interesting and especially at a time in the real world where the advancements seem to be heating up but the whole pickpocketing the key for 2 hours also got boring so fast. Too many cliches started piling up. The hand to hand combat was some of the weakest stuff I've seen it a while especially the Venice bridge scene, it looked awful, like I could see the choreography. The best scene for me was the desert storm at the start which really had my attention but everything after that seemed just average.I don't know if everyone else is now completely over their only trick being having someone go as someone else with these masks. It's so boring to me now and at a stage I'm kinda rolling my eyes. I really hope the machine blowing a fuse means we have seen the last of them.Tom Cruise is awesome with the stunts he does and will always have respect for the things him doing them but I really wish they didn't show the motorbike cliff jump scene in the trailer. What you see in the trailer is literally the whole stunt, don't get me wrong it's truly impressive but they showed the whole thing and just completely killed it for me.I'm slightly bummed with this one and just coming off seeing Indian Jones and having a lot more fun watching that. I don't care about runtimes but you have to have me sucked in and the whole time, I felt the time...People will love this movie but M:I may have fizzled out with me a bit after this one.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Greetings again from the darkness. The challenge in continuing the \"Mission: Impossible\" franchise is that fans expect each entry to be \"bigger\" and more awe-inspiring than the last. With the seventh film in the series, and the third straight he has directed, writer-director Christopher McQuarrie and superstar actor and daredevil Tom Cruise have managed to accomplish what seemed unlikely ... they have delivered Ethan Hunt's biggest and grandest mission yet. Prepare to be awed by the action.You should know that this is \"Part One\" and it runs 163 minutes, a full hour longer than most movies, and exponentially more expensive to produce. All this during an age when ultra-high-budget blockbusters are being rumored to be fading from public interest. Of course, we are only one year removed from Tom Cruise's TOP GUN: MAVERICK being credited with 'saving cinema', so stay on alert for a 'sky is falling' panic. McQuarrie co-wrote the script with Erik Jendresen (\"Band of Brothers\"), and they remain faithful to the characters and storylines established by the TV series creator, Bruce Geller.There may never have been an actor more suited to a recurring role than Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt (Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones might be the closest). The story itself is fairly straightforward, even if the item being chased often feels like a MacGuffin. Your questioning of how a 'simple' spy-thriller can be effective is understandable, yet it's fascinating to watch as Ethan Hunt's mission in life as an agent is evaluated, as is the cost he's paid as a man. Providing a contemporary theme, the obscure object of desire is an all-powerful key (actually two parts of a key) based on controlling an all-encompassing Artificial Intelligence (AI).In a twist on a familiar theme (and a classic comedy film), we have Airports, Trains, and EVs, the latter being a tiny Fiat with handcuffs. Still, the car chase is everything we might hope, while the high-tech facial search in the airport sequence delivers the thrills for techie viewers, and the train sparring occurs inside as well as on top. And lest you be worried, there are enough Cruise sprint scenes here to put CHARIOTS OF FIRE to shame.Familiar faces include Ethan Hunt's team of Luther (Ving Rhames, who along with Cruise, has appeared in all 7 MI films), Benji (Simon Pegg), and Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). It's nice to again see (and hear) Henry Czerny as Kittridge, Vanessa Kirby as arms dealer The White Widow, and Esai Morales - as Gabriel, the required villain in search of the same key as our good guys. New faces include Haylee Atwell as master pickpocket Grace, whose soul may or may not be beyond salvation; Cary Elwes as agency director Denlinger; Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis as officers after rogue Hunt; and Pom Klementieff as a hired assassin.The stunt work here is outstanding, and of course, Tom Cruise is renowned for personally handling many of the most breathtaking acts - the most memorable one here being his riding of a motorcycle off a cliff. This stunt has a 'making of' video that's been available for a while. As movie goers, we've never seen anything like it. This part one was originally scheduled for release in 2021 (thanks a lot, COVID), and now Part Two is set for 2024. It's been 27 years since the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE (1996) with Jon Voight ... Cruise was 34 in that one. This particular mission is the biggest yet, and it would certainly be impossible for the rest of us. It's a mission that will be closed out in Part Two, and simultaneously bring an end to Cruise's remarkable run as Ethan Hunt.Opening July 12, 2023.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: This movie started out promising but by the end, it just felt like being robbed of two and a half hours. I am a big fan of the MI movies (including MI2, which people seem to hate) and I could appreciate this movie for the few scenes that it did right, but it treats the audience like idiots in its bland, repetitive storyline (how many times do we need to hear the words \"the key\" and \"the entity\"? It was as if the writers of this movie just gave up on their jobs when they wrote this. Easily the weakest MI movie ever filmed. It had me staring at my watch every 20 minutes. As others have mentioned, the character development in this movie is also truly awful. I have barely any interest in seeing Part Two of Dead Reckoning at this point. The high scores this movie is getting absolutely baffle me. This movie by no means deserves a score higher than a 6 or a 6.5.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Basically, this movie is big, loud, and stupid.Definitely TOO loud, in fact. The music attempts to turn even the most minor scene into some sort of heart-pounding climax.There are endless ridiculous fights in which Tom Cruise is predictably unstoppable, no matter how many opponents he's up against. Slim girls get to beat up multiple men. (Emily Blunt was right when, commenting on a fight in \"Sicario\" in which, refreshingly, she loses to a bigger guy, she noted that Hollywood fight scenes in which 110-pound women whip larger males are \"so cheesy.\")The dull, tepid, way-too-pretty villain is, implausibly, a formidable fighter but sure doesn't look like one. An action movie is only as good as its villain is evil; this guy looks like a French fashion mogul.He and Cruise fight on top of -- wait for it -- a moving train! Haven't we seen that ridiculous sort of thing a hundred times before?The tediously overcomplicated plot makes it hard to keep track of who's on which side, nor do we care. Apparently, as is usual these days, we're supposed to root against the U. S. government.In all scenes involving conversations, virtually EVERY line is merely plot exposition in which characters tell us, in stilted dialogue, what's going on, what's supposed to happen, and how we're supposed to feel.The much-touted parachute jump is actually disappointing. It's over quite fast, and its main source of interest is that, if you've seen the promotional video, you know that Cruise himself actually made that jump.The only truly enjoyable sequence -- the cleverly worked-out rescue attempts on the falling train -- comes at the end, after nearly two and a half hours of empty cartoonish nonsense...Including, of course, an overlong cartoonish car chase, obligatory in dumb summer movies.\n",

It feels huge the whole time however I must say I while the set pieces were stellar, the hand to hand combat scenes were not great and a big step down from the last film (Fallout).Thebeginning is slow with a lot of expository being dumped (more than you'd usually see) but once it gets going it is pretty nonstop.This is a good chapter and Haley Atwell shines but it is nowhere near my favorite of the series.7/10Mi rankingsMi6 Fallout\n",

            "Skipping non-numeric rating: 'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part I (M:I7) is another strong entry in the action/spy series, with Ethan (Cruise) looking slightly older, but not less determined to save the world. I believe the sequel to this film will be his last outing - but we'll see. This time, there's some Skynet-like sentient-AI that's manipulating nefarious types to take over the world, so the IMF team are out to get the two halves of key that can stop it.Isla (Ferguson), Benji (Pegg) and Luther (Rhames) are back, as well as CIA boss Kittridge (Czerny), with Grace (Atwell), a thief, being the newcomer. The bad guys that keep thwarting them are Gabriel (Morales) from Ethan's past, and Paris (Klementieff). The consistency of having McQuarrie as director of the two previous films helps, with everything feeling assured and this working as a really solid follow-up to 'Fallout'.There's some funny moments, some sincere ones, and some of Ethan running, as contractually-obliged. The whole final scene on the train is excellent, with so many things happening, but there's plenty of good set-pieces throughout, including a good car chase. However, the piece-de-resistance is the motorbike off the cliff into a BASE jump is something else. The fact Cruise did it for real, multiple times, is crazy and inspiring.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Man.... I wish I loved this movie more than I did. Don't get me wrong, it's a solid action movie with jaw-dropping stunts (some of the best in the series), but as a Mission: Impossible movie, it felt like a small step backward for the franchise. Fallout had mind-blowing action sequences and stunt work, along with developing Ethan's relationship with Ilsa, providing closure with Julia, showing the lengths Ethan would go to protect those closest to him, and battling an imposing villain. Dead Reckoning: Part One stretches the movie across two films only to seemingly showcase action spectacle after action spectacle while sacrificing character development. Characters I have grown to love over a decade of films felt sidelined, ignored, or wasted. Hayley Atwell's new character chewed up most of the screen time, and while she was fantastic, I wanted to see more of the original team. The new villain had an inconsistent ability that confused more than intimidated. There were some important emotional moments that I just didn't feel the weight of when I definitely should have. Part Two might tie everything together and make me enjoy Part One more in retrospect, but unfortunately, I left wanting more from this one.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Just got out of seeing this movie. I am really disappointed that they totally killed off the potential relationship between Ethan and Ilsa. I am totally OK with her dying but the way that they did it and how anti-climactic it was after building up her character so much in the previous two films. Just seems like she would've deserved a better death than that. Also, what was the point of showing the two characters getting closer to each other, and in the last film, his ex-wife, basically giving them permission to move forward when you're just going to kill her off like that. Honestly, Rebecca Ferguson revised this franchise two movies ago and I think killing off her character was a big mistake. Even in the scenes that she's in it doesn't even seem like she's playing the same person. I wonder if they wrote her out of the movie because she's too busy with the rest of her work. Hayley Atwell's character doesn't make sense to me either. Just put her in the IMF because she can pick some pockets? This all seems forced. Maybe most won't agree, but I think this development totally ruined the movie for me.\n",

The sheer scale of this movie is epic, and with every twist and turn of the movie, you cannot help but marvel at the incredible sets used to bring this movie to life. Such a movie begs to be seen on the biggest screen possible where you can truly feel the grandeur of the film. Tom Cruise has once again delivered one of the best movies of the year, and I cannot recommend that you see it enough!\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: To me, a new M:I film is an event. From Part 4 onwards, they've been spectacular (all 10/10's).There's some good stuff here for sure, and overall it's a solid 8, but it's simply not as good as previous entries.I kept noticing that a lot of scenes had just 2 or 3 people in them, and I kept imagining the crew all masked up, as well as the cast when the camera wasn't on them. It can't be easy to make a huge movie like this during a pandemic, but it definitely shows.The A. I. plot is quite good, and Hunt's as-yet-unknown backstory quite intriguing, but the whole story basically revolves around: \"I've got the key, now she's got the key, now he's got the key\" etc. So much pick-pocketing.Also, I really wish they hadn't ruined the motorcycle jump in the promos. If you've seen the promo, you've seen the scene. There are really only 3 or 4 action sequences, and nothing we haven't really seen before. I actually enjoyed the first desert shoot-out the best.And- oh!- the exposition! There's a scene near the beginning that reminded me of a Neil Breen(!) movie, where powerful people sit in a room and just spout buzz words like \"nuclear war,\" \"economic collapse,\" \"dogs and cats living together\" etc.THAT said, it's still an 8/10. Tom always gives it his best, the rest of the cast is good (especially all four female leads) and I thought the added humour with Hunt's character was a nice touch. I'd rather watch this ten times over than any blatant cyncial Disney cash-grab.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Good God. I feel ashamed for approaching this film with a modicum of doubt that Tom would still be able to deliver. Unbelievably, this epic actually manages to top the brilliant Fallout. Tom is literally going to die if he keeps doing these stunts. The motorbike sequence is utterly ludicrous. Intriguing plot with actual stakes and some familiar faces ably supported by brilliant new allies and villains. Sets up Part II perfectly with a sensational finale that homages Back to the Future 3, MI:1 and Speed. It is funny, action packed, polished and exhilarating. Harrison was great last week, but Tom is still the King. 9/10.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: I was lucky to be able to watch this 4 days before its official release in Czech Republic as a pre-premiere (didn't know such a thing existed) and it was the first time I've felt real excitement to go watch a film at the cinema in ages thanks to the recent genius combination of Fallout and Top Gun 2.I know what they were trying to do with this film. Bringing Kittridge back and a convoluted train finale all harked back to the 1st movie that sparked it all off. Explaining that convoluted storyline along the way harks back to the criticisms made about that same first film.The sky jump stunt was an attempt to beat the stunts from Tom Cruise in previous installments that have now become a beloved trademark of the franchise.But this film unfortunately overall is most reminiscent of the second installment which was Tom Cruise centric and lacked any real impossible mission requiring teamwork, real stakes and ingenious problem solving.In fact, it could have even been intentional that this film reminds the viewer of Mission Impossible 2. The photos in the film of past Ethan Hunt when searching for present Ethan Hunt show him with his longer hair as he looked in that second film.Ultimately, I expected the story to be way better than what we get in this instalment.There are 2 guys that keep appearing at each scene trying to catch Ethan which seems a very cheap simple story.And the very simple plot is explained in long scenes to make it seem way more complicated that it actually is (people complained there should be more explanation in the first film, but at least the plot in the first film actually required brain power), and I have to say that some of the acting is quite poor at times, not helped by some rather cheesy lines in the script, including the lines and accents in the opening Russian submarine sequence.There is also not that much action. 3 main action sequences for a close to 3 hour movie, which are the desert shoot out at the beginning, the Venice car chase, and the train crash at the end.I thought the alleyway fight scene, which some have praised, was really quite subpar and not very enthralling.The best action scene is the Venice car chase because it is genuinely funny (yes, because it is excellently laugh out loud funny, but not in any way tense); I never had the feeling that I was on the edge of my seat.The motorcycle sky jump scene was a major disappointment after the hype because if you didn't know Cruise actually did do that stunt, they used so much CGI that people would just assume it was computer generated. It actually reminded me of Pierce Brosnan's riding the tsunami in Die Another Day (sorry Tom! The stunt is still awesome!).The same for the train at the end. I know they actually made that train, and probably actually threw it off a bridge, but it doesn't look real. Though it is a long action finale and very fun to watch, for me the lack of realism takes away any tension. You are enjoying it for its visual value, but again not feeling any 'wow' factor or tension.At the end of Fallout, for example, you really felt Ethan Hunt was battered, bruised, worn out and still fighting to save humanity. There is none of that.The most tragic thing about this movie is that, unlike in the best of the previous films, we're back to the team being irrelevant in this one. Benji and Luther don't actually do very much.And poor Ilsa. Fallout ended with Ethan's ex-wife essentially giving him permission to move on and be with Ilsa.The relationship between Ilsa and Hunt had been built up over two excellent movies - Rogue Nation and Fallout - and in this film she says almost nothing, looks grumpy and sad all the time, and dies in an anticlimactic fight that is literally spelt out to the audience as a way to replace her with newcomer Grace.Grace, played by Hayley Atwell, is good. A likeable character and a capable actress, but I don't get the story unless Rebecca Ferguson said she wants out the franchise.The film is all about chasing \"the key.\" No twists. No high stakes. There is virtually no grittiness in this outing. It feels very light.Ultimately I was hoping to enjoy a quality film in the franchise. A movie like Oblivion, Edge of Tomorrow, Fallout, Top Gun 2 or American Made that you can show to anyone and say these are recent really high quality films starring this guy called Tom Cruise.This is not one of those films.It is more like The Mummy. It is better than Mission Impossible 2 but not better than any of the others in the franchise.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One confirms that Mission Impossible is the best franchise currently going and possibly ever made. A 2 hour 43 minute adrenaline rush that contains some of the best action sequences put to film, embarrasses the majority of the competition out there and sets the stage for a magnificent part 2 whilst still being a satisfying adventure in its own right.This is possibly the most open and obvious a Mission film has been with its deeper meaning for cinema and what aspect of Cruise's career is being dissected this time with a film that focuses on Ethan's relationship with women and basically outright declares AI to be a soulless monster and how the human element is always needed (perfect film to release during a writer's strike).Tom Cruise is perfect as Ethan Hunt and the strongest aspect this time round is when the film explores what made Ethan who he is and reminds you he genuinely cares about his team but that comes at a cost. Physically, the madman is still going strong with his stunts, driving a bike off a cliff in truly breathtaking fashion.Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg and Rebecca Ferguson remain the best IMF team and all play to their strengths here. The longer this series goes on the more authentic their growing friendship feels. Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis get more than expected and their buddy cop antics are a lot of fun.With Esai Morales' charismatic yet terrifying Gabriel and Pom Klementieff's terrific henchman of few words, this franchise finally has more good villains than bad. The return of Henry Czerny as Kittridge is glorious and he remains as gleefully despicable as his first appearance.The best new addition is easily Hayley Atwell. She plays a type of character never seen before in these films which makes her character and dynamic with Cruise fresh in comparison to everyone who's come before and their chemistry is magnetic. Instantaneous from the second they interact.Christopher McQuarrie's direction is phenomenal. The action sequences are suitably practical (this is how you spend $290 million), and the camera gets as close to the action as humanly possible, he remains one of the best in the business working at this scale. There's plenty of canted angles as a nice homage to De Palma's original and it helps give this one its own style in comparison to McQuarrie's previous entries.The pacing is really impressive with the film feeling like it's in a perpetual third act from its first airport heist (which is so much fun). Lorne Balfe does the music once again and yet again it's a highlight of the film, he knows how to elevate everything so well and really hammers home the emotional beats.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Ethan Hunt has left the mere secret agent status and has ascended to the all living perfect messiah.There is so much wrong with this movie, which seriously pains me because I seriously love this series. The mission impossible movies have steadily become more convoluted and more stupidly written. This film reaches the peak of absurdity, feeling more like an over the top fast and furious movie. All foolish action, cheap parlor tricks to pull the heart strings (empty relationships), horrible writing, poor plot development.I mean seriously what ever happened to show don't tell?! This is becoming rather ridiculous.*convoluted villain dialogue*\n",
            "\"So what you're telling me is you plan to establish a new world order if you get that key and if someone stops you that would be bad?!\"Has Ethan Hunt suddenly become this vanilla James Bond? With the Bond girl cycling through every few films? Lazy writing. Not natural feeling. Forced. BlighIt pains me to give this so low.The truth is, this movie is mindless entertaining action. Tom Cruise delivers on some awesome stunts (seldom compared to other MI films). It's not horrible. It's fun entertainment, but a scour on the (in my opinion) reputable authentic feeling mission impossible series.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: So you probably watched IM 6 and said, they can't make it any better can they? Or Top Gun 2, guess again, this is an adrenaline action movie with a good story, well written, action scenes that just blow you away, not a boring moment and you are on the edge of your seat all the time, this is how you make movies! Tom Cruise did it again, WOW!! It's an exhausting ride he takes you on, man I forgot to eat my popcorn and by the time i finally wanted some my wife had eaten all of it, but hey I was so immersed into the movie that time stood still and i forgot everything around me.Go and see it, this one gets my full recommendation, the only reason it's not a 10 is due to the fact it's not a completely new type of movie, however this one is done as a good action movie should be made, i don't see how they could have made it better, I really can't, go watch it and have a good time while you do it, it will put a big smile on your face that's for sure.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Am huge fan of MI franchise. The best part about all MI movies were how they plan and pull off an impossible mission. Thus I am quite disappointed on how this mission never seemed too difficult , let alone impossible.Action was okay. Car chase was funny, but not exciting. Jumping off the cliff seemed forced to me. Why would you keep driving uphill when you can take short cuts to reach the train. It wasn't even a fast train. The key kept being stolen from pockets too many times which makes you wonder how lazy the scripting was. Kill old gf to make new gf was also lazy writing.Unlike other MIs, Ethan had no single smart move or plan. It felt more like let's go and see what happens.Am not sure how MI fans ignored all these weaknesses and gave this film 8+ rating.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: This was a great movie. However, it lost a star from me for making the audience believe Ilsa is dead. They've spent two films building up Ilsa as being Ethan's equal, and hinted at an eventual romance. She's been able to fight off multiple men bare-handed yet she meets her demise by one guy when she has a sword? Then they brush past her death like it means nothing, only for her to be replaced by a new woman. I thought it was a huge disservice to the character.I know Rebecca Ferguson is very busy so she might have asked to leave, but I'm hoping this isn't the end for my favorite character in these films. She deserves a happy ending, or at least a better death than the one she received in this movie. It really took me out of the rest of the film. Hopefully, we'll see her again in Part Two.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Remember that classic MI scene where they broke in at CIA, and Cruise was hanging from the ceiling using wires? It's not a huge setpiece, but that scene is a nailbiting example of ingenious problem solving.In 'Dead Reckoning' there's none of that. Here it's keys changing hands every 10 minutes that is suppose to pass as suspense. And of course the only true selling point: the stunts performed by Tom Cruise.But I want and expect more than that.A large part of the film is devoted to people sitting or standing in a room, explaining what the plot is. Endless talking and explaining. We are told in several scenes the same information we just heard. Worst one is Benji, who is merely there to repeat things for someone in the cast, to make sure everyone in the audience knows what is going on. That is sloppy writing. One of the biggest no-no's as a screenwriter is resolving to \"so what you are saying is, that...\" info sharing. Benji does this all the time. And he is as incompetent as usual. And he is supposed to be a part of a small and unique team that is saving the world? Really?I hope MI:8 isn't just another Tom Cruise stunt reel where it looks like they make the story up as the go along, as long as all marks are checked in the end (running, face swapping, dealing with heights etc), and where character development takes a backseat. Bigger is not always better. And the action ALWAYS has to serve the story, not the other way around.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: After the first 30 minutes that promised an intellectual action thriller, the film starts its nosedive into mediocrity by introducing a thief who constantly indulges in disloyalty, for petty gains, towards the IMF and Hunt, but is held in high regards by Hunt. For the life of me, I couldn't understand why. The film also doesn't bother with it.Neither is it concerned with the so called action set pieces. _Fallout_ had plethora of those, one after the other, tied together by a cogent story line. For all its hype, it has 2-3 in a run time of close to 160 minutes, which tested my patience.Reading it's critics' reviews post viewing make me feel as if they have been written by the Entity, the AI behemoth at the center of this. The perceived entertainment value implied by them is not even remotely connected with the reality.It is no wonder that it is faltering at the US box office. It is no Top Gun- Maverick. Crowds are going to turn up, especially outside the US, because of Cruise's star power. But I don't believe this will please most of them.Disappointing.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: An absolute masterclass in producing an enjoyable action movie. Cinematography was great, the story was paced extremely well, and the casting of ALL roles was absolutely perfect.Cruise, Pegg and Rhames were awesome as always, Whigham and Davis were great additions, but the power quartet of Ferguson, Atwell, Klementieff and Kirby, really went above and beyond in making this movie perfect. Not to mention the chilling confidence of Morales as Gabriel, who practically oozes tangible danger.From the pre-opening credits scene to the final act, if you're like me, you will be on the edge of your seat - especially during any fight scene that involves Ferguson or Klementieff - and whilst there are moments that the tempo slows down to advance the story, it is always completely captivating.The single, solitary, disappointment comes as the credits roll, and you remember you're going to have to wait until next year to see how it ends.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Absolutely superb! Was hoping they could do the impossible and surpass Fallout! And Cruise, McQuarrie and co have accomplished this in spades, delivering the best spy/ action thriller in years.It is a next level masterclass of a film, with everything you would expect from an Mission Impossible film and more.The cast are great, with the new additions adding so much to the usual MI crew. The stunts are performed to the usual high standard and give you that Wow feeling you want, The story is fantastic, leaving you wanting more, setting up Part Two really wellGo see this on the best screen possible.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: It should be impossible to fumble the bag so badly on a nostalgia trip movie like this. Just let Tom Cruise run, do some crazy stunts and play the iconic theme music. But no they gotta drag on for three hours with a meaningless storyline just for it to be one part of an incomplete movie. Like whatever happened to movie editing? There's no reason for this movie to be this long and a lot of the content is completely unnecessary to move the plot forward. I don't expect MI movies to have watertight logic but then atleast the writers shouldn't twist themselves into knots thinking they're making a deeper movie than they are, the sooner these movie trends with AI, quantum space tunneling, multiverse nonsense end the better it is for good storylines.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: This latest Mission: Impossible movie is a slam dunk that needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible. Tom Cruise certainly knows how to make a movie. In another universe Cruse could have been Iron Man and I always felt that his aggression with the Mission: Impossible franchise was his way of making up for that. That's probably why the dialog in this movie felt like Ethan Hawk was captain America or something and they are going up against a Bonafede supervillain in the form of an A. I system. As far as I'm concern the best villain of the franchise snice the late and great Phillip Seymour Huffman.The Avengers Assemble as franchise regulars Simon Pegg as Dunn and Ving Rhimes, who I say with glee, started this franchise with Cruse as Luther, make their return as IMF agents. Rebecca Ferguson reprises her role from the last movie and Haley Atwell is in the movie as well, but none of this makes me as happy as Ving still being in the franchise.The action sequences are so good in this picture. It was worth having to stay in me seat for almost three hours just so they can add a little more action in-between the Hero's journey dialogue.And this is just part one!? Part two has some big shoes to fill!\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: I love Tom Cruise movies, but this one feels pretty contrived. Beyond the plot, Grace was the biggest detriment to the movie. The character started out amusing but her shtick became insufferable and Ethan's infatuation idiotic. How they handled Ilsa feels both rushed and cheap, with no emotional weight felt. The biggest stunt was spoiled beforehand which I suppose did its job in getting me in the seat, but totally ruins the moment in film. The final act also lacked any tension and was honestly a little boring - there wasn't any real cleverness.Still, it was humorous throughout, had a good amount of charm and the production value is evident. That's enough for me to be above average but it's unlikely I'll watch the followup in theater.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: As a hardout Mission fan. I can confirm 5 years was definitely worth the wait. The film is extremally charming and filled with exciting humor, action and story-telling. Tom and Hayley really bring the film so much joy and create wonderful chemistry. The chase scene in Rome puts you on the edge of your seat and nothing prepares you for the daring things Tom and Hayley pull off in the train sequence.. Tom really understands the action genre and did not disappoint with this film. There is a perfect blend between foundation building for the story and the action sequences. The film is a beautiful set up to the part 2 coming next year.. Brilliant Watch 100/10.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Straight up Dead Reckoning Part 1 was fine. I think it's the weakest out of the last four instalments.I can't put my finger on one exact thing but it just felt a little underdone compared to the last few M:I and was expecting big things the whole movie. It was a combination of things like the acting felt a little weak I guess, the script was just fine, the action was decent but not great compared to other M:I and to the likes of John Wick that I'm now used to. The plot with the A. I is nothing new but it's always still interesting and especially at a time in the real world where the advancements seem to be heating up but the whole pickpocketing the key for 2 hours also got boring so fast. Too many cliches started piling up. The hand to hand combat was some of the weakest stuff I've seen it a while especially the Venice bridge scene, it looked awful, like I could see the choreography. The best scene for me was the desert storm at the start which really had my attention but everything after that seemed just average.I don't know if everyone else is now completely over their only trick being having someone go as someone else with these masks. It's so boring to me now and at a stage I'm kinda rolling my eyes. I really hope the machine blowing a fuse means we have seen the last of them.Tom Cruise is awesome with the stunts he does and will always have respect for the things him doing them but I really wish they didn't show the motorbike cliff jump scene in the trailer. What you see in the trailer is literally the whole stunt, don't get me wrong it's truly impressive but they showed the whole thing and just completely killed it for me.I'm slightly bummed with this one and just coming off seeing Indian Jones and having a lot more fun watching that. I don't care about runtimes but you have to have me sucked in and the whole time, I felt the time...People will love this movie but M:I may have fizzled out with me a bit after this one.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Greetings again from the darkness. The challenge in continuing the \"Mission: Impossible\" franchise is that fans expect each entry to be \"bigger\" and more awe-inspiring than the last. With the seventh film in the series, and the third straight he has directed, writer-director Christopher McQuarrie and superstar actor and daredevil Tom Cruise have managed to accomplish what seemed unlikely ... they have delivered Ethan Hunt's biggest and grandest mission yet. Prepare to be awed by the action.You should know that this is \"Part One\" and it runs 163 minutes, a full hour longer than most movies, and exponentially more expensive to produce. All this during an age when ultra-high-budget blockbusters are being rumored to be fading from public interest. Of course, we are only one year removed from Tom Cruise's TOP GUN: MAVERICK being credited with 'saving cinema', so stay on alert for a 'sky is falling' panic. McQuarrie co-wrote the script with Erik Jendresen (\"Band of Brothers\"), and they remain faithful to the characters and storylines established by the TV series creator, Bruce Geller.There may never have been an actor more suited to a recurring role than Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt (Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones might be the closest). The story itself is fairly straightforward, even if the item being chased often feels like a MacGuffin. Your questioning of how a 'simple' spy-thriller can be effective is understandable, yet it's fascinating to watch as Ethan Hunt's mission in life as an agent is evaluated, as is the cost he's paid as a man. Providing a contemporary theme, the obscure object of desire is an all-powerful key (actually two parts of a key) based on controlling an all-encompassing Artificial Intelligence (AI).In a twist on a familiar theme (and a classic comedy film), we have Airports, Trains, and EVs, the latter being a tiny Fiat with handcuffs. Still, the car chase is everything we might hope, while the high-tech facial search in the airport sequence delivers the thrills for techie viewers, and the train sparring occurs inside as well as on top. And lest you be worried, there are enough Cruise sprint scenes here to put CHARIOTS OF FIRE to shame.Familiar faces include Ethan Hunt's team of Luther (Ving Rhames, who along with Cruise, has appeared in all 7 MI films), Benji (Simon Pegg), and Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). It's nice to again see (and hear) Henry Czerny as Kittridge, Vanessa Kirby as arms dealer The White Widow, and Esai Morales - as Gabriel, the required villain in search of the same key as our good guys. New faces include Haylee Atwell as master pickpocket Grace, whose soul may or may not be beyond salvation; Cary Elwes as agency director Denlinger; Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis as officers after rogue Hunt; and Pom Klementieff as a hired assassin.The stunt work here is outstanding, and of course, Tom Cruise is renowned for personally handling many of the most breathtaking acts - the most memorable one here being his riding of a motorcycle off a cliff. This stunt has a 'making of' video that's been available for a while. As movie goers, we've never seen anything like it. This part one was originally scheduled for release in 2021 (thanks a lot, COVID), and now Part Two is set for 2024. It's been 27 years since the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE (1996) with Jon Voight ... Cruise was 34 in that one. This particular mission is the biggest yet, and it would certainly be impossible for the rest of us. It's a mission that will be closed out in Part Two, and simultaneously bring an end to Cruise's remarkable run as Ethan Hunt.Opening July 12, 2023.\n",

I am a big fan of the MI movies (including MI2, which people seem to hate) and I could appreciate this movie for the few scenes that it did right, but it treats the audience like idiots in its bland, repetitive storyline (how many times do we need to hear the words \"the key\" and \"the entity\"? It was as if the writers of this movie just gave up on their jobs when they wrote this. Easily the weakest MI movie ever filmed. It had me staring at my watch every 20 minutes. As others have mentioned, the character development in this movie is also truly awful. I have barely any interest in seeing Part Two of Dead Reckoning at this point. The high scores this movie is getting absolutely baffle me. This movie by no means deserves a score higher than a 6 or a 6.5.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Basically, this movie is big, loud, and stupid.Definitely TOO loud, in fact. The music attempts to turn even the most minor scene into some sort of heart-pounding climax.There are endless ridiculous fights in which Tom Cruise is predictably unstoppable, no matter how many opponents he's up against. Slim girls get to beat up multiple men. (Emily Blunt was right when, commenting on a fight in \"Sicario\" in which, refreshingly, she loses to a bigger guy, she noted that Hollywood fight scenes in which 110-pound women whip larger males are \"so cheesy.\")The dull, tepid, way-too-pretty villain is, implausibly, a formidable fighter but sure doesn't look like one. An action movie is only as good as its villain is evil; this guy looks like a French fashion mogul.He and Cruise fight on top of -- wait for it -- a moving train! Haven't we seen that ridiculous sort of thing a hundred times before?The tediously overcomplicated plot makes it hard to keep track of who's on which side, nor do we care. Apparently, as is usual these days, we're supposed to root against the U. S. government.In all scenes involving conversations, virtually EVERY line is merely plot exposition in which characters tell us, in stilted dialogue, what's going on, what's supposed to happen, and how we're supposed to feel.The much-touted parachute jump is actually disappointing. It's over quite fast, and its main source of interest is that, if you've seen the promotional video, you know that Cruise himself actually made that jump.The only truly enjoyable sequence -- the cleverly worked-out rescue attempts on the falling train -- comes at the end, after nearly two and a half hours of empty cartoonish nonsense...Including, of course, an overlong cartoonish car chase, obligatory in dumb summer movies.\n",

            "Skipping non-numeric rating: 'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part I (M:I7) is another strong entry in the action/spy series, with Ethan (Cruise) looking slightly older, but not less determined to save the world. I believe the sequel to this film will be his last outing - but we'll see. This time, there's some Skynet-like sentient-AI that's manipulating nefarious types to take over the world, so the IMF team are out to get the two halves of key that can stop it.Isla (Ferguson), Benji (Pegg) and Luther (Rhames) are back, as well as CIA boss Kittridge (Czerny), with Grace (Atwell), a thief, being the newcomer. The bad guys that keep thwarting them are Gabriel (Morales) from Ethan's past, and Paris (Klementieff). The consistency of having McQuarrie as director of the two previous films helps, with everything feeling assured and this working as a really solid follow-up to 'Fallout'.There's some funny moments, some sincere ones, and some of Ethan running, as contractually-obliged. The whole final scene on the train is excellent, with so many things happening, but there's plenty of good set-pieces throughout, including a good car chase. However, the piece-de-resistance is the motorbike off the cliff into a BASE jump is something else. The fact Cruise did it for real, multiple times, is crazy and inspiring.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Man.... I wish I loved this movie more than I did. Don't get me wrong, it's a solid action movie with jaw-dropping stunts (some of the best in the series), but as a Mission: Impossible movie, it felt like a small step backward for the franchise. Fallout had mind-blowing action sequences and stunt work, along with developing Ethan's relationship with Ilsa, providing closure with Julia, showing the lengths Ethan would go to protect those closest to him, and battling an imposing villain. Dead Reckoning: Part One stretches the movie across two films only to seemingly showcase action spectacle after action spectacle while sacrificing character development. Characters I have grown to love over a decade of films felt sidelined, ignored, or wasted. Hayley Atwell's new character chewed up most of the screen time, and while she was fantastic, I wanted to see more of the original team. The new villain had an inconsistent ability that confused more than intimidated. There were some important emotional moments that I just didn't feel the weight of when I definitely should have. Part Two might tie everything together and make me enjoy Part One more in retrospect, but unfortunately, I left wanting more from this one.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Just got out of seeing this movie. I am really disappointed that they totally killed off the potential relationship between Ethan and Ilsa. I am totally OK with her dying but the way that they did it and how anti-climactic it was after building up her character so much in the previous two films. Just seems like she would've deserved a better death than that. Also, what was the point of showing the two characters getting closer to each other, and in the last film, his ex-wife, basically giving them permission to move forward when you're just going to kill her off like that. Honestly, Rebecca Ferguson revised this franchise two movies ago and I think killing off her character was a big mistake. Even in the scenes that she's in it doesn't even seem like she's playing the same person. I wonder if they wrote her out of the movie because she's too busy with the rest of her work. Hayley Atwell's character doesn't make sense to me either. Just put her in the IMF because she can pick some pockets? This all seems forced. Maybe most won't agree, but I think this development totally ruined the movie for me.\n",

The sheer scale of this movie is epic, and with every twist and turn of the movie, you cannot help but marvel at the incredible sets used to bring this movie to life. Such a movie begs to be seen on the biggest screen possible where you can truly feel the grandeur of the film. Tom Cruise has once again delivered one of the best movies of the year, and I cannot recommend that you see it enough!\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: To me, a new M:I film is an event. From Part 4 onwards, they've been spectacular (all 10/10's).There's some good stuff here for sure, and overall it's a solid 8, but it's simply not as good as previous entries.I kept noticing that a lot of scenes had just 2 or 3 people in them, and I kept imagining the crew all masked up, as well as the cast when the camera wasn't on them. It can't be easy to make a huge movie like this during a pandemic, but it definitely shows.The A. I. plot is quite good, and Hunt's as-yet-unknown backstory quite intriguing, but the whole story basically revolves around: \"I've got the key, now she's got the key, now he's got the key\" etc. So much pick-pocketing.Also, I really wish they hadn't ruined the motorcycle jump in the promos. If you've seen the promo, you've seen the scene. There are really only 3 or 4 action sequences, and nothing we haven't really seen before. I actually enjoyed the first desert shoot-out the best.And- oh!- the exposition! There's a scene near the beginning that reminded me of a Neil Breen(!) movie, where powerful people sit in a room and just spout buzz words like \"nuclear war,\" \"economic collapse,\" \"dogs and cats living together\" etc.THAT said, it's still an 8/10. Tom always gives it his best, the rest of the cast is good (especially all four female leads) and I thought the added humour with Hunt's character was a nice touch. I'd rather watch this ten times over than any blatant cyncial Disney cash-grab.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Good God. I feel ashamed for approaching this film with a modicum of doubt that Tom would still be able to deliver. Unbelievably, this epic actually manages to top the brilliant Fallout. Tom is literally going to die if he keeps doing these stunts. The motorbike sequence is utterly ludicrous. Intriguing plot with actual stakes and some familiar faces ably supported by brilliant new allies and villains. Sets up Part II perfectly with a sensational finale that homages Back to the Future 3, MI:1 and Speed. It is funny, action packed, polished and exhilarating. Harrison was great last week, but Tom is still the King. 9/10.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: I was lucky to be able to watch this 4 days before its official release in Czech Republic as a pre-premiere (didn't know such a thing existed) and it was the first time I've felt real excitement to go watch a film at the cinema in ages thanks to the recent genius combination of Fallout and Top Gun 2.I know what they were trying to do with this film. Bringing Kittridge back and a convoluted train finale all harked back to the 1st movie that sparked it all off. Explaining that convoluted storyline along the way harks back to the criticisms made about that same first film.The sky jump stunt was an attempt to beat the stunts from Tom Cruise in previous installments that have now become a beloved trademark of the franchise.But this film unfortunately overall is most reminiscent of the second installment which was Tom Cruise centric and lacked any real impossible mission requiring teamwork, real stakes and ingenious problem solving.In fact, it could have even been intentional that this film reminds the viewer of Mission Impossible 2. The photos in the film of past Ethan Hunt when searching for present Ethan Hunt show him with his longer hair as he looked in that second film.Ultimately, I expected the story to be way better than what we get in this instalment.There are 2 guys that keep appearing at each scene trying to catch Ethan which seems a very cheap simple story.And the very simple plot is explained in long scenes to make it seem way more complicated that it actually is (people complained there should be more explanation in the first film, but at least the plot in the first film actually required brain power), and I have to say that some of the acting is quite poor at times, not helped by some rather cheesy lines in the script, including the lines and accents in the opening Russian submarine sequence.There is also not that much action. 3 main action sequences for a close to 3 hour movie, which are the desert shoot out at the beginning, the Venice car chase, and the train crash at the end.I thought the alleyway fight scene, which some have praised, was really quite subpar and not very enthralling.The best action scene is the Venice car chase because it is genuinely funny (yes, because it is excellently laugh out loud funny, but not in any way tense); I never had the feeling that I was on the edge of my seat.The motorcycle sky jump scene was a major disappointment after the hype because if you didn't know Cruise actually did do that stunt, they used so much CGI that people would just assume it was computer generated. It actually reminded me of Pierce Brosnan's riding the tsunami in Die Another Day (sorry Tom! The stunt is still awesome!).The same for the train at the end. I know they actually made that train, and probably actually threw it off a bridge, but it doesn't look real. Though it is a long action finale and very fun to watch, for me the lack of realism takes away any tension. You are enjoying it for its visual value, but again not feeling any 'wow' factor or tension.At the end of Fallout, for example, you really felt Ethan Hunt was battered, bruised, worn out and still fighting to save humanity. There is none of that.The most tragic thing about this movie is that, unlike in the best of the previous films, we're back to the team being irrelevant in this one. Benji and Luther don't actually do very much.And poor Ilsa. Fallout ended with Ethan's ex-wife essentially giving him permission to move on and be with Ilsa.The relationship between Ilsa and Hunt had been built up over two excellent movies - Rogue Nation and Fallout - and in this film she says almost nothing, looks grumpy and sad all the time, and dies in an anticlimactic fight that is literally spelt out to the audience as a way to replace her with newcomer Grace.Grace, played by Hayley Atwell, is good. A likeable character and a capable actress, but I don't get the story unless Rebecca Ferguson said she wants out the franchise.The film is all about chasing \"the key.\" No twists. No high stakes. There is virtually no grittiness in this outing. It feels very light.Ultimately I was hoping to enjoy a quality film in the franchise. A movie like Oblivion, Edge of Tomorrow, Fallout, Top Gun 2 or American Made that you can show to anyone and say these are recent really high quality films starring this guy called Tom Cruise.This is not one of those films.It is more like The Mummy. It is better than Mission Impossible 2 but not better than any of the others in the franchise.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One confirms that Mission Impossible is the best franchise currently going and possibly ever made. A 2 hour 43 minute adrenaline rush that contains some of the best action sequences put to film, embarrasses the majority of the competition out there and sets the stage for a magnificent part 2 whilst still being a satisfying adventure in its own right.This is possibly the most open and obvious a Mission film has been with its deeper meaning for cinema and what aspect of Cruise's career is being dissected this time with a film that focuses on Ethan's relationship with women and basically outright declares AI to be a soulless monster and how the human element is always needed (perfect film to release during a writer's strike).Tom Cruise is perfect as Ethan Hunt and the strongest aspect this time round is when the film explores what made Ethan who he is and reminds you he genuinely cares about his team but that comes at a cost. Physically, the madman is still going strong with his stunts, driving a bike off a cliff in truly breathtaking fashion.Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg and Rebecca Ferguson remain the best IMF team and all play to their strengths here. The longer this series goes on the more authentic their growing friendship feels. Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis get more than expected and their buddy cop antics are a lot of fun.With Esai Morales' charismatic yet terrifying Gabriel and Pom Klementieff's terrific henchman of few words, this franchise finally has more good villains than bad. The return of Henry Czerny as Kittridge is glorious and he remains as gleefully despicable as his first appearance.The best new addition is easily Hayley Atwell. She plays a type of character never seen before in these films which makes her character and dynamic with Cruise fresh in comparison to everyone who's come before and their chemistry is magnetic. Instantaneous from the second they interact.Christopher McQuarrie's direction is phenomenal. The action sequences are suitably practical (this is how you spend $290 million), and the camera gets as close to the action as humanly possible, he remains one of the best in the business working at this scale. There's plenty of canted angles as a nice homage to De Palma's original and it helps give this one its own style in comparison to McQuarrie's previous entries.The pacing is really impressive with the film feeling like it's in a perpetual third act from its first airport heist (which is so much fun). Lorne Balfe does the music once again and yet again it's a highlight of the film, he knows how to elevate everything so well and really hammers home the emotional beats.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Ethan Hunt has left the mere secret agent status and has ascended to the all living perfect messiah.There is so much wrong with this movie, which seriously pains me because I seriously love this series. The mission impossible movies have steadily become more convoluted and more stupidly written. This film reaches the peak of absurdity, feeling more like an over the top fast and furious movie. All foolish action, cheap parlor tricks to pull the heart strings (empty relationships), horrible writing, poor plot development.I mean seriously what ever happened to show don't tell?! This is becoming rather ridiculous.*convoluted villain dialogue*\n",
            "\"So what you're telling me is you plan to establish a new world order if you get that key and if someone stops you that would be bad?!\"Has Ethan Hunt suddenly become this vanilla James Bond? With the Bond girl cycling through every few films? Lazy writing. Not natural feeling. Forced. BlighIt pains me to give this so low.The truth is, this movie is mindless entertaining action. Tom Cruise delivers on some awesome stunts (seldom compared to other MI films). It's not horrible. It's fun entertainment, but a scour on the (in my opinion) reputable authentic feeling mission impossible series.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: So you probably watched IM 6 and said, they can't make it any better can they? Or Top Gun 2, guess again, this is an adrenaline action movie with a good story, well written, action scenes that just blow you away, not a boring moment and you are on the edge of your seat all the time, this is how you make movies! Tom Cruise did it again, WOW!! It's an exhausting ride he takes you on, man I forgot to eat my popcorn and by the time i finally wanted some my wife had eaten all of it, but hey I was so immersed into the movie that time stood still and i forgot everything around me.Go and see it, this one gets my full recommendation, the only reason it's not a 10 is due to the fact it's not a completely new type of movie, however this one is done as a good action movie should be made, i don't see how they could have made it better, I really can't, go watch it and have a good time while you do it, it will put a big smile on your face that's for sure.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Am huge fan of MI franchise. The best part about all MI movies were how they plan and pull off an impossible mission. Thus I am quite disappointed on how this mission never seemed too difficult , let alone impossible.Action was okay. Car chase was funny, but not exciting. Jumping off the cliff seemed forced to me. Why would you keep driving uphill when you can take short cuts to reach the train. It wasn't even a fast train. The key kept being stolen from pockets too many times which makes you wonder how lazy the scripting was. Kill old gf to make new gf was also lazy writing.Unlike other MIs, Ethan had no single smart move or plan. It felt more like let's go and see what happens.Am not sure how MI fans ignored all these weaknesses and gave this film 8+ rating.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: This was a great movie. However, it lost a star from me for making the audience believe Ilsa is dead. They've spent two films building up Ilsa as being Ethan's equal, and hinted at an eventual romance. She's been able to fight off multiple men bare-handed yet she meets her demise by one guy when she has a sword? Then they brush past her death like it means nothing, only for her to be replaced by a new woman. I thought it was a huge disservice to the character.I know Rebecca Ferguson is very busy so she might have asked to leave, but I'm hoping this isn't the end for my favorite character in these films. She deserves a happy ending, or at least a better death than the one she received in this movie. It really took me out of the rest of the film. Hopefully, we'll see her again in Part Two.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Remember that classic MI scene where they broke in at CIA, and Cruise was hanging from the ceiling using wires? It's not a huge setpiece, but that scene is a nailbiting example of ingenious problem solving.In 'Dead Reckoning' there's none of that. Here it's keys changing hands every 10 minutes that is suppose to pass as suspense. And of course the only true selling point: the stunts performed by Tom Cruise.But I want and expect more than that.A large part of the film is devoted to people sitting or standing in a room, explaining what the plot is. Endless talking and explaining. We are told in several scenes the same information we just heard. Worst one is Benji, who is merely there to repeat things for someone in the cast, to make sure everyone in the audience knows what is going on. That is sloppy writing. One of the biggest no-no's as a screenwriter is resolving to \"so what you are saying is, that...\" info sharing. Benji does this all the time. And he is as incompetent as usual. And he is supposed to be a part of a small and unique team that is saving the world? Really?I hope MI:8 isn't just another Tom Cruise stunt reel where it looks like they make the story up as the go along, as long as all marks are checked in the end (running, face swapping, dealing with heights etc), and where character development takes a backseat. Bigger is not always better. And the action ALWAYS has to serve the story, not the other way around.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: After the first 30 minutes that promised an intellectual action thriller, the film starts its nosedive into mediocrity by introducing a thief who constantly indulges in disloyalty, for petty gains, towards the IMF and Hunt, but is held in high regards by Hunt. For the life of me, I couldn't understand why. The film also doesn't bother with it.Neither is it concerned with the so called action set pieces. _Fallout_ had plethora of those, one after the other, tied together by a cogent story line. For all its hype, it has 2-3 in a run time of close to 160 minutes, which tested my patience.Reading it's critics' reviews post viewing make me feel as if they have been written by the Entity, the AI behemoth at the center of this. The perceived entertainment value implied by them is not even remotely connected with the reality.It is no wonder that it is faltering at the US box office. It is no Top Gun- Maverick. Crowds are going to turn up, especially outside the US, because of Cruise's star power. But I don't believe this will please most of them.Disappointing.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: An absolute masterclass in producing an enjoyable action movie. Cinematography was great, the story was paced extremely well, and the casting of ALL roles was absolutely perfect.Cruise, Pegg and Rhames were awesome as always, Whigham and Davis were great additions, but the power quartet of Ferguson, Atwell, Klementieff and Kirby, really went above and beyond in making this movie perfect. Not to mention the chilling confidence of Morales as Gabriel, who practically oozes tangible danger.From the pre-opening credits scene to the final act, if you're like me, you will be on the edge of your seat - especially during any fight scene that involves Ferguson or Klementieff - and whilst there are moments that the tempo slows down to advance the story, it is always completely captivating.The single, solitary, disappointment comes as the credits roll, and you remember you're going to have to wait until next year to see how it ends.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Absolutely superb! Was hoping they could do the impossible and surpass Fallout! And Cruise, McQuarrie and co have accomplished this in spades, delivering the best spy/ action thriller in years.It is a next level masterclass of a film, with everything you would expect from an Mission Impossible film and more.The cast are great, with the new additions adding so much to the usual MI crew. The stunts are performed to the usual high standard and give you that Wow feeling you want, The story is fantastic, leaving you wanting more, setting up Part Two really wellGo see this on the best screen possible.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: It should be impossible to fumble the bag so badly on a nostalgia trip movie like this. Just let Tom Cruise run, do some crazy stunts and play the iconic theme music. But no they gotta drag on for three hours with a meaningless storyline just for it to be one part of an incomplete movie. Like whatever happened to movie editing? There's no reason for this movie to be this long and a lot of the content is completely unnecessary to move the plot forward. I don't expect MI movies to have watertight logic but then atleast the writers shouldn't twist themselves into knots thinking they're making a deeper movie than they are, the sooner these movie trends with AI, quantum space tunneling, multiverse nonsense end the better it is for good storylines.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: This latest Mission: Impossible movie is a slam dunk that needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible. Tom Cruise certainly knows how to make a movie. In another universe Cruse could have been Iron Man and I always felt that his aggression with the Mission: Impossible franchise was his way of making up for that. That's probably why the dialog in this movie felt like Ethan Hawk was captain America or something and they are going up against a Bonafede supervillain in the form of an A. I system. As far as I'm concern the best villain of the franchise snice the late and great Phillip Seymour Huffman.The Avengers Assemble as franchise regulars Simon Pegg as Dunn and Ving Rhimes, who I say with glee, started this franchise with Cruse as Luther, make their return as IMF agents. Rebecca Ferguson reprises her role from the last movie and Haley Atwell is in the movie as well, but none of this makes me as happy as Ving still being in the franchise.The action sequences are so good in this picture. It was worth having to stay in me seat for almost three hours just so they can add a little more action in-between the Hero's journey dialogue.And this is just part one!? Part two has some big shoes to fill!\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: I love Tom Cruise movies, but this one feels pretty contrived. Beyond the plot, Grace was the biggest detriment to the movie. The character started out amusing but her shtick became insufferable and Ethan's infatuation idiotic. How they handled Ilsa feels both rushed and cheap, with no emotional weight felt. The biggest stunt was spoiled beforehand which I suppose did its job in getting me in the seat, but totally ruins the moment in film. The final act also lacked any tension and was honestly a little boring - there wasn't any real cleverness.Still, it was humorous throughout, had a good amount of charm and the production value is evident. That's enough for me to be above average but it's unlikely I'll watch the followup in theater.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: As a hardout Mission fan. I can confirm 5 years was definitely worth the wait. The film is extremally charming and filled with exciting humor, action and story-telling. Tom and Hayley really bring the film so much joy and create wonderful chemistry. The chase scene in Rome puts you on the edge of your seat and nothing prepares you for the daring things Tom and Hayley pull off in the train sequence.. Tom really understands the action genre and did not disappoint with this film. There is a perfect blend between foundation building for the story and the action sequences. The film is a beautiful set up to the part 2 coming next year.. Brilliant Watch 100/10.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Straight up Dead Reckoning Part 1 was fine. I think it's the weakest out of the last four instalments.I can't put my finger on one exact thing but it just felt a little underdone compared to the last few M:I and was expecting big things the whole movie. It was a combination of things like the acting felt a little weak I guess, the script was just fine, the action was decent but not great compared to other M:I and to the likes of John Wick that I'm now used to. The plot with the A. I is nothing new but it's always still interesting and especially at a time in the real world where the advancements seem to be heating up but the whole pickpocketing the key for 2 hours also got boring so fast. Too many cliches started piling up. The hand to hand combat was some of the weakest stuff I've seen it a while especially the Venice bridge scene, it looked awful, like I could see the choreography. The best scene for me was the desert storm at the start which really had my attention but everything after that seemed just average.I don't know if everyone else is now completely over their only trick being having someone go as someone else with these masks. It's so boring to me now and at a stage I'm kinda rolling my eyes. I really hope the machine blowing a fuse means we have seen the last of them.Tom Cruise is awesome with the stunts he does and will always have respect for the things him doing them but I really wish they didn't show the motorbike cliff jump scene in the trailer. What you see in the trailer is literally the whole stunt, don't get me wrong it's truly impressive but they showed the whole thing and just completely killed it for me.I'm slightly bummed with this one and just coming off seeing Indian Jones and having a lot more fun watching that. I don't care about runtimes but you have to have me sucked in and the whole time, I felt the time...People will love this movie but M:I may have fizzled out with me a bit after this one.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Greetings again from the darkness. The challenge in continuing the \"Mission: Impossible\" franchise is that fans expect each entry to be \"bigger\" and more awe-inspiring than the last. With the seventh film in the series, and the third straight he has directed, writer-director Christopher McQuarrie and superstar actor and daredevil Tom Cruise have managed to accomplish what seemed unlikely ... they have delivered Ethan Hunt's biggest and grandest mission yet. Prepare to be awed by the action.You should know that this is \"Part One\" and it runs 163 minutes, a full hour longer than most movies, and exponentially more expensive to produce. All this during an age when ultra-high-budget blockbusters are being rumored to be fading from public interest. Of course, we are only one year removed from Tom Cruise's TOP GUN: MAVERICK being credited with 'saving cinema', so stay on alert for a 'sky is falling' panic. McQuarrie co-wrote the script with Erik Jendresen (\"Band of Brothers\"), and they remain faithful to the characters and storylines established by the TV series creator, Bruce Geller.There may never have been an actor more suited to a recurring role than Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt (Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones might be the closest). The story itself is fairly straightforward, even if the item being chased often feels like a MacGuffin. Your questioning of how a 'simple' spy-thriller can be effective is understandable, yet it's fascinating to watch as Ethan Hunt's mission in life as an agent is evaluated, as is the cost he's paid as a man. Providing a contemporary theme, the obscure object of desire is an all-powerful key (actually two parts of a key) based on controlling an all-encompassing Artificial Intelligence (AI).In a twist on a familiar theme (and a classic comedy film), we have Airports, Trains, and EVs, the latter being a tiny Fiat with handcuffs. Still, the car chase is everything we might hope, while the high-tech facial search in the airport sequence delivers the thrills for techie viewers, and the train sparring occurs inside as well as on top. And lest you be worried, there are enough Cruise sprint scenes here to put CHARIOTS OF FIRE to shame.Familiar faces include Ethan Hunt's team of Luther (Ving Rhames, who along with Cruise, has appeared in all 7 MI films), Benji (Simon Pegg), and Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). It's nice to again see (and hear) Henry Czerny as Kittridge, Vanessa Kirby as arms dealer The White Widow, and Esai Morales - as Gabriel, the required villain in search of the same key as our good guys. New faces include Haylee Atwell as master pickpocket Grace, whose soul may or may not be beyond salvation; Cary Elwes as agency director Denlinger; Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis as officers after rogue Hunt; and Pom Klementieff as a hired assassin.The stunt work here is outstanding, and of course, Tom Cruise is renowned for personally handling many of the most breathtaking acts - the most memorable one here being his riding of a motorcycle off a cliff. This stunt has a 'making of' video that's been available for a while. As movie goers, we've never seen anything like it. This part one was originally scheduled for release in 2021 (thanks a lot, COVID), and now Part Two is set for 2024. It's been 27 years since the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE (1996) with Jon Voight ... Cruise was 34 in that one. This particular mission is the biggest yet, and it would certainly be impossible for the rest of us. It's a mission that will be closed out in Part Two, and simultaneously bring an end to Cruise's remarkable run as Ethan Hunt.Opening July 12, 2023.\n",

I am a big fan of the MI movies (including MI2, which people seem to hate) and I could appreciate this movie for the few scenes that it did right, but it treats the audience like idiots in its bland, repetitive storyline (how many times do we need to hear the words \"the key\" and \"the entity\"? It was as if the writers of this movie just gave up on their jobs when they wrote this. Easily the weakest MI movie ever filmed. It had me staring at my watch every 20 minutes. As others have mentioned, the character development in this movie is also truly awful. I have barely any interest in seeing Part Two of Dead Reckoning at this point. The high scores this movie is getting absolutely baffle me. This movie by no means deserves a score higher than a 6 or a 6.5.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Basically, this movie is big, loud, and stupid.Definitely TOO loud, in fact. The music attempts to turn even the most minor scene into some sort of heart-pounding climax.There are endless ridiculous fights in which Tom Cruise is predictably unstoppable, no matter how many opponents he's up against. Slim girls get to beat up multiple men. (Emily Blunt was right when, commenting on a fight in \"Sicario\" in which, refreshingly, she loses to a bigger guy, she noted that Hollywood fight scenes in which 110-pound women whip larger males are \"so cheesy.\")The dull, tepid, way-too-pretty villain is, implausibly, a formidable fighter but sure doesn't look like one. An action movie is only as good as its villain is evil; this guy looks like a French fashion mogul.He and Cruise fight on top of -- wait for it -- a moving train! Haven't we seen that ridiculous sort of thing a hundred times before?The tediously overcomplicated plot makes it hard to keep track of who's on which side, nor do we care. Apparently, as is usual these days, we're supposed to root against the U. S. government.In all scenes involving conversations, virtually EVERY line is merely plot exposition in which characters tell us, in stilted dialogue, what's going on, what's supposed to happen, and how we're supposed to feel.The much-touted parachute jump is actually disappointing. It's over quite fast, and its main source of interest is that, if you've seen the promotional video, you know that Cruise himself actually made that jump.The only truly enjoyable sequence -- the cleverly worked-out rescue attempts on the falling train -- comes at the end, after nearly two and a half hours of empty cartoonish nonsense...Including, of course, an overlong cartoonish car chase, obligatory in dumb summer movies.\n",

            "Skipping non-numeric rating: 'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part I (M:I7) is another strong entry in the action/spy series, with Ethan (Cruise) looking slightly older, but not less determined to save the world. I believe the sequel to this film will be his last outing - but we'll see. This time, there's some Skynet-like sentient-AI that's manipulating nefarious types to take over the world, so the IMF team are out to get the two halves of key that can stop it.Isla (Ferguson), Benji (Pegg) and Luther (Rhames) are back, as well as CIA boss Kittridge (Czerny), with Grace (Atwell), a thief, being the newcomer. The bad guys that keep thwarting them are Gabriel (Morales) from Ethan's past, and Paris (Klementieff). The consistency of having McQuarrie as director of the two previous films helps, with everything feeling assured and this working as a really solid follow-up to 'Fallout'.There's some funny moments, some sincere ones, and some of Ethan running, as contractually-obliged. The whole final scene on the train is excellent, with so many things happening, but there's plenty of good set-pieces throughout, including a good car chase. However, the piece-de-resistance is the motorbike off the cliff into a BASE jump is something else. The fact Cruise did it for real, multiple times, is crazy and inspiring.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Man.... I wish I loved this movie more than I did. Don't get me wrong, it's a solid action movie with jaw-dropping stunts (some of the best in the series), but as a Mission: Impossible movie, it felt like a small step backward for the franchise. Fallout had mind-blowing action sequences and stunt work, along with developing Ethan's relationship with Ilsa, providing closure with Julia, showing the lengths Ethan would go to protect those closest to him, and battling an imposing villain. Dead Reckoning: Part One stretches the movie across two films only to seemingly showcase action spectacle after action spectacle while sacrificing character development. Characters I have grown to love over a decade of films felt sidelined, ignored, or wasted. Hayley Atwell's new character chewed up most of the screen time, and while she was fantastic, I wanted to see more of the original team. The new villain had an inconsistent ability that confused more than intimidated. There were some important emotional moments that I just didn't feel the weight of when I definitely should have. Part Two might tie everything together and make me enjoy Part One more in retrospect, but unfortunately, I left wanting more from this one.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Just got out of seeing this movie. I am really disappointed that they totally killed off the potential relationship between Ethan and Ilsa. I am totally OK with her dying but the way that they did it and how anti-climactic it was after building up her character so much in the previous two films. Just seems like she would've deserved a better death than that. Also, what was the point of showing the two characters getting closer to each other, and in the last film, his ex-wife, basically giving them permission to move forward when you're just going to kill her off like that. Honestly, Rebecca Ferguson revised this franchise two movies ago and I think killing off her character was a big mistake. Even in the scenes that she's in it doesn't even seem like she's playing the same person. I wonder if they wrote her out of the movie because she's too busy with the rest of her work. Hayley Atwell's character doesn't make sense to me either. Just put her in the IMF because she can pick some pockets? This all seems forced. Maybe most won't agree, but I think this development totally ruined the movie for me.\n",

From Part 4 onwards, they've been spectacular (all 10/10's).There's some good stuff here for sure, and overall it's a solid 8, but it's simply not as good as previous entries.I kept noticing that a lot of scenes had just 2 or 3 people in them, and I kept imagining the crew all masked up, as well as the cast when the camera wasn't on them. It can't be easy to make a huge movie like this during a pandemic, but it definitely shows.The A. I. plot is quite good, and Hunt's as-yet-unknown backstory quite intriguing, but the whole story basically revolves around: \"I've got the key, now she's got the key, now he's got the key\" etc. So much pick-pocketing.Also, I really wish they hadn't ruined the motorcycle jump in the promos. If you've seen the promo, you've seen the scene. There are really only 3 or 4 action sequences, and nothing we haven't really seen before. I actually enjoyed the first desert shoot-out the best.And- oh!- the exposition! There's a scene near the beginning that reminded me of a Neil Breen(!) movie, where powerful people sit in a room and just spout buzz words like \"nuclear war,\" \"economic collapse,\" \"dogs and cats living together\" etc.THAT said, it's still an 8/10. Tom always gives it his best, the rest of the cast is good (especially all four female leads) and I thought the added humour with Hunt's character was a nice touch. I'd rather watch this ten times over than any blatant cyncial Disney cash-grab.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Good God. I feel ashamed for approaching this film with a modicum of doubt that Tom would still be able to deliver. Unbelievably, this epic actually manages to top the brilliant Fallout. Tom is literally going to die if he keeps doing these stunts. The motorbike sequence is utterly ludicrous. Intriguing plot with actual stakes and some familiar faces ably supported by brilliant new allies and villains. Sets up Part II perfectly with a sensational finale that homages Back to the Future 3, MI:1 and Speed. It is funny, action packed, polished and exhilarating. Harrison was great last week, but Tom is still the King. 9/10.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: I was lucky to be able to watch this 4 days before its official release in Czech Republic as a pre-premiere (didn't know such a thing existed) and it was the first time I've felt real excitement to go watch a film at the cinema in ages thanks to the recent genius combination of Fallout and Top Gun 2.I know what they were trying to do with this film. Bringing Kittridge back and a convoluted train finale all harked back to the 1st movie that sparked it all off. Explaining that convoluted storyline along the way harks back to the criticisms made about that same first film.The sky jump stunt was an attempt to beat the stunts from Tom Cruise in previous installments that have now become a beloved trademark of the franchise.But this film unfortunately overall is most reminiscent of the second installment which was Tom Cruise centric and lacked any real impossible mission requiring teamwork, real stakes and ingenious problem solving.In fact, it could have even been intentional that this film reminds the viewer of Mission Impossible 2. The photos in the film of past Ethan Hunt when searching for present Ethan Hunt show him with his longer hair as he looked in that second film.Ultimately, I expected the story to be way better than what we get in this instalment.There are 2 guys that keep appearing at each scene trying to catch Ethan which seems a very cheap simple story.And the very simple plot is explained in long scenes to make it seem way more complicated that it actually is (people complained there should be more explanation in the first film, but at least the plot in the first film actually required brain power), and I have to say that some of the acting is quite poor at times, not helped by some rather cheesy lines in the script, including the lines and accents in the opening Russian submarine sequence.There is also not that much action. 3 main action sequences for a close to 3 hour movie, which are the desert shoot out at the beginning, the Venice car chase, and the train crash at the end.I thought the alleyway fight scene, which some have praised, was really quite subpar and not very enthralling.The best action scene is the Venice car chase because it is genuinely funny (yes, because it is excellently laugh out loud funny, but not in any way tense); I never had the feeling that I was on the edge of my seat.The motorcycle sky jump scene was a major disappointment after the hype because if you didn't know Cruise actually did do that stunt, they used so much CGI that people would just assume it was computer generated. It actually reminded me of Pierce Brosnan's riding the tsunami in Die Another Day (sorry Tom! The stunt is still awesome!).The same for the train at the end. I know they actually made that train, and probably actually threw it off a bridge, but it doesn't look real. Though it is a long action finale and very fun to watch, for me the lack of realism takes away any tension. You are enjoying it for its visual value, but again not feeling any 'wow' factor or tension.At the end of Fallout, for example, you really felt Ethan Hunt was battered, bruised, worn out and still fighting to save humanity. There is none of that.The most tragic thing about this movie is that, unlike in the best of the previous films, we're back to the team being irrelevant in this one. Benji and Luther don't actually do very much.And poor Ilsa. Fallout ended with Ethan's ex-wife essentially giving him permission to move on and be with Ilsa.The relationship between Ilsa and Hunt had been built up over two excellent movies - Rogue Nation and Fallout - and in this film she says almost nothing, looks grumpy and sad all the time, and dies in an anticlimactic fight that is literally spelt out to the audience as a way to replace her with newcomer Grace.Grace, played by Hayley Atwell, is good. A likeable character and a capable actress, but I don't get the story unless Rebecca Ferguson said she wants out the franchise.The film is all about chasing \"the key.\" No twists. No high stakes. There is virtually no grittiness in this outing. It feels very light.Ultimately I was hoping to enjoy a quality film in the franchise. A movie like Oblivion, Edge of Tomorrow, Fallout, Top Gun 2 or American Made that you can show to anyone and say these are recent really high quality films starring this guy called Tom Cruise.This is not one of those films.It is more like The Mummy. It is better than Mission Impossible 2 but not better than any of the others in the franchise.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One confirms that Mission Impossible is the best franchise currently going and possibly ever made. A 2 hour 43 minute adrenaline rush that contains some of the best action sequences put to film, embarrasses the majority of the competition out there and sets the stage for a magnificent part 2 whilst still being a satisfying adventure in its own right.This is possibly the most open and obvious a Mission film has been with its deeper meaning for cinema and what aspect of Cruise's career is being dissected this time with a film that focuses on Ethan's relationship with women and basically outright declares AI to be a soulless monster and how the human element is always needed (perfect film to release during a writer's strike).Tom Cruise is perfect as Ethan Hunt and the strongest aspect this time round is when the film explores what made Ethan who he is and reminds you he genuinely cares about his team but that comes at a cost. Physically, the madman is still going strong with his stunts, driving a bike off a cliff in truly breathtaking fashion.Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg and Rebecca Ferguson remain the best IMF team and all play to their strengths here. The longer this series goes on the more authentic their growing friendship feels. Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis get more than expected and their buddy cop antics are a lot of fun.With Esai Morales' charismatic yet terrifying Gabriel and Pom Klementieff's terrific henchman of few words, this franchise finally has more good villains than bad. The return of Henry Czerny as Kittridge is glorious and he remains as gleefully despicable as his first appearance.The best new addition is easily Hayley Atwell. She plays a type of character never seen before in these films which makes her character and dynamic with Cruise fresh in comparison to everyone who's come before and their chemistry is magnetic. Instantaneous from the second they interact.Christopher McQuarrie's direction is phenomenal. The action sequences are suitably practical (this is how you spend $290 million), and the camera gets as close to the action as humanly possible, he remains one of the best in the business working at this scale. There's plenty of canted angles as a nice homage to De Palma's original and it helps give this one its own style in comparison to McQuarrie's previous entries.The pacing is really impressive with the film feeling like it's in a perpetual third act from its first airport heist (which is so much fun). Lorne Balfe does the music once again and yet again it's a highlight of the film, he knows how to elevate everything so well and really hammers home the emotional beats.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Ethan Hunt has left the mere secret agent status and has ascended to the all living perfect messiah.There is so much wrong with this movie, which seriously pains me because I seriously love this series. The mission impossible movies have steadily become more convoluted and more stupidly written. This film reaches the peak of absurdity, feeling more like an over the top fast and furious movie. All foolish action, cheap parlor tricks to pull the heart strings (empty relationships), horrible writing, poor plot development.I mean seriously what ever happened to show don't tell?! This is becoming rather ridiculous.*convoluted villain dialogue*\n",
            "\"So what you're telling me is you plan to establish a new world order if you get that key and if someone stops you that would be bad?!\"Has Ethan Hunt suddenly become this vanilla James Bond? With the Bond girl cycling through every few films? Lazy writing. Not natural feeling. Forced. BlighIt pains me to give this so low.The truth is, this movie is mindless entertaining action. Tom Cruise delivers on some awesome stunts (seldom compared to other MI films). It's not horrible. It's fun entertainment, but a scour on the (in my opinion) reputable authentic feeling mission impossible series.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: So you probably watched IM 6 and said, they can't make it any better can they? Or Top Gun 2, guess again, this is an adrenaline action movie with a good story, well written, action scenes that just blow you away, not a boring moment and you are on the edge of your seat all the time, this is how you make movies! Tom Cruise did it again, WOW!! It's an exhausting ride he takes you on, man I forgot to eat my popcorn and by the time i finally wanted some my wife had eaten all of it, but hey I was so immersed into the movie that time stood still and i forgot everything around me.Go and see it, this one gets my full recommendation, the only reason it's not a 10 is due to the fact it's not a completely new type of movie, however this one is done as a good action movie should be made, i don't see how they could have made it better, I really can't, go watch it and have a good time while you do it, it will put a big smile on your face that's for sure.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Am huge fan of MI franchise. The best part about all MI movies were how they plan and pull off an impossible mission. Thus I am quite disappointed on how this mission never seemed too difficult , let alone impossible.Action was okay. Car chase was funny, but not exciting. Jumping off the cliff seemed forced to me. Why would you keep driving uphill when you can take short cuts to reach the train. It wasn't even a fast train. The key kept being stolen from pockets too many times which makes you wonder how lazy the scripting was. Kill old gf to make new gf was also lazy writing.Unlike other MIs, Ethan had no single smart move or plan. It felt more like let's go and see what happens.Am not sure how MI fans ignored all these weaknesses and gave this film 8+ rating.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: This was a great movie. However, it lost a star from me for making the audience believe Ilsa is dead. They've spent two films building up Ilsa as being Ethan's equal, and hinted at an eventual romance. She's been able to fight off multiple men bare-handed yet she meets her demise by one guy when she has a sword? Then they brush past her death like it means nothing, only for her to be replaced by a new woman. I thought it was a huge disservice to the character.I know Rebecca Ferguson is very busy so she might have asked to leave, but I'm hoping this isn't the end for my favorite character in these films. She deserves a happy ending, or at least a better death than the one she received in this movie. It really took me out of the rest of the film. Hopefully, we'll see her again in Part Two.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Remember that classic MI scene where they broke in at CIA, and Cruise was hanging from the ceiling using wires? It's not a huge setpiece, but that scene is a nailbiting example of ingenious problem solving.In 'Dead Reckoning' there's none of that. Here it's keys changing hands every 10 minutes that is suppose to pass as suspense. And of course the only true selling point: the stunts performed by Tom Cruise.But I want and expect more than that.A large part of the film is devoted to people sitting or standing in a room, explaining what the plot is. Endless talking and explaining. We are told in several scenes the same information we just heard. Worst one is Benji, who is merely there to repeat things for someone in the cast, to make sure everyone in the audience knows what is going on. That is sloppy writing. One of the biggest no-no's as a screenwriter is resolving to \"so what you are saying is, that...\" info sharing. Benji does this all the time. And he is as incompetent as usual. And he is supposed to be a part of a small and unique team that is saving the world? Really?I hope MI:8 isn't just another Tom Cruise stunt reel where it looks like they make the story up as the go along, as long as all marks are checked in the end (running, face swapping, dealing with heights etc), and where character development takes a backseat. Bigger is not always better. And the action ALWAYS has to serve the story, not the other way around.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: After the first 30 minutes that promised an intellectual action thriller, the film starts its nosedive into mediocrity by introducing a thief who constantly indulges in disloyalty, for petty gains, towards the IMF and Hunt, but is held in high regards by Hunt. For the life of me, I couldn't understand why. The film also doesn't bother with it.Neither is it concerned with the so called action set pieces. _Fallout_ had plethora of those, one after the other, tied together by a cogent story line. For all its hype, it has 2-3 in a run time of close to 160 minutes, which tested my patience.Reading it's critics' reviews post viewing make me feel as if they have been written by the Entity, the AI behemoth at the center of this. The perceived entertainment value implied by them is not even remotely connected with the reality.It is no wonder that it is faltering at the US box office. It is no Top Gun- Maverick. Crowds are going to turn up, especially outside the US, because of Cruise's star power. But I don't believe this will please most of them.Disappointing.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: An absolute masterclass in producing an enjoyable action movie. Cinematography was great, the story was paced extremely well, and the casting of ALL roles was absolutely perfect.Cruise, Pegg and Rhames were awesome as always, Whigham and Davis were great additions, but the power quartet of Ferguson, Atwell, Klementieff and Kirby, really went above and beyond in making this movie perfect. Not to mention the chilling confidence of Morales as Gabriel, who practically oozes tangible danger.From the pre-opening credits scene to the final act, if you're like me, you will be on the edge of your seat - especially during any fight scene that involves Ferguson or Klementieff - and whilst there are moments that the tempo slows down to advance the story, it is always completely captivating.The single, solitary, disappointment comes as the credits roll, and you remember you're going to have to wait until next year to see how it ends.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Absolutely superb! Was hoping they could do the impossible and surpass Fallout! And Cruise, McQuarrie and co have accomplished this in spades, delivering the best spy/ action thriller in years.It is a next level masterclass of a film, with everything you would expect from an Mission Impossible film and more.The cast are great, with the new additions adding so much to the usual MI crew. The stunts are performed to the usual high standard and give you that Wow feeling you want, The story is fantastic, leaving you wanting more, setting up Part Two really wellGo see this on the best screen possible.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: It should be impossible to fumble the bag so badly on a nostalgia trip movie like this. Just let Tom Cruise run, do some crazy stunts and play the iconic theme music. But no they gotta drag on for three hours with a meaningless storyline just for it to be one part of an incomplete movie. Like whatever happened to movie editing? There's no reason for this movie to be this long and a lot of the content is completely unnecessary to move the plot forward. I don't expect MI movies to have watertight logic but then atleast the writers shouldn't twist themselves into knots thinking they're making a deeper movie than they are, the sooner these movie trends with AI, quantum space tunneling, multiverse nonsense end the better it is for good storylines.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: This latest Mission: Impossible movie is a slam dunk that needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible. Tom Cruise certainly knows how to make a movie. In another universe Cruse could have been Iron Man and I always felt that his aggression with the Mission: Impossible franchise was his way of making up for that. That's probably why the dialog in this movie felt like Ethan Hawk was captain America or something and they are going up against a Bonafede supervillain in the form of an A. I system. As far as I'm concern the best villain of the franchise snice the late and great Phillip Seymour Huffman.The Avengers Assemble as franchise regulars Simon Pegg as Dunn and Ving Rhimes, who I say with glee, started this franchise with Cruse as Luther, make their return as IMF agents. Rebecca Ferguson reprises her role from the last movie and Haley Atwell is in the movie as well, but none of this makes me as happy as Ving still being in the franchise.The action sequences are so good in this picture. It was worth having to stay in me seat for almost three hours just so they can add a little more action in-between the Hero's journey dialogue.And this is just part one!? Part two has some big shoes to fill!\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: I love Tom Cruise movies, but this one feels pretty contrived. Beyond the plot, Grace was the biggest detriment to the movie. The character started out amusing but her shtick became insufferable and Ethan's infatuation idiotic. How they handled Ilsa feels both rushed and cheap, with no emotional weight felt. The biggest stunt was spoiled beforehand which I suppose did its job in getting me in the seat, but totally ruins the moment in film. The final act also lacked any tension and was honestly a little boring - there wasn't any real cleverness.Still, it was humorous throughout, had a good amount of charm and the production value is evident. That's enough for me to be above average but it's unlikely I'll watch the followup in theater.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: As a hardout Mission fan. I can confirm 5 years was definitely worth the wait. The film is extremally charming and filled with exciting humor, action and story-telling. Tom and Hayley really bring the film so much joy and create wonderful chemistry. The chase scene in Rome puts you on the edge of your seat and nothing prepares you for the daring things Tom and Hayley pull off in the train sequence.. Tom really understands the action genre and did not disappoint with this film. There is a perfect blend between foundation building for the story and the action sequences. The film is a beautiful set up to the part 2 coming next year.. Brilliant Watch 100/10.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Straight up Dead Reckoning Part 1 was fine. I think it's the weakest out of the last four instalments.I can't put my finger on one exact thing but it just felt a little underdone compared to the last few M:I and was expecting big things the whole movie. It was a combination of things like the acting felt a little weak I guess, the script was just fine, the action was decent but not great compared to other M:I and to the likes of John Wick that I'm now used to. The plot with the A. I is nothing new but it's always still interesting and especially at a time in the real world where the advancements seem to be heating up but the whole pickpocketing the key for 2 hours also got boring so fast. Too many cliches started piling up. The hand to hand combat was some of the weakest stuff I've seen it a while especially the Venice bridge scene, it looked awful, like I could see the choreography. The best scene for me was the desert storm at the start which really had my attention but everything after that seemed just average.I don't know if everyone else is now completely over their only trick being having someone go as someone else with these masks. It's so boring to me now and at a stage I'm kinda rolling my eyes. I really hope the machine blowing a fuse means we have seen the last of them.Tom Cruise is awesome with the stunts he does and will always have respect for the things him doing them but I really wish they didn't show the motorbike cliff jump scene in the trailer. What you see in the trailer is literally the whole stunt, don't get me wrong it's truly impressive but they showed the whole thing and just completely killed it for me.I'm slightly bummed with this one and just coming off seeing Indian Jones and having a lot more fun watching that. I don't care about runtimes but you have to have me sucked in and the whole time, I felt the time...People will love this movie but M:I may have fizzled out with me a bit after this one.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Greetings again from the darkness. The challenge in continuing the \"Mission: Impossible\" franchise is that fans expect each entry to be \"bigger\" and more awe-inspiring than the last. With the seventh film in the series, and the third straight he has directed, writer-director Christopher McQuarrie and superstar actor and daredevil Tom Cruise have managed to accomplish what seemed unlikely ... they have delivered Ethan Hunt's biggest and grandest mission yet. Prepare to be awed by the action.You should know that this is \"Part One\" and it runs 163 minutes, a full hour longer than most movies, and exponentially more expensive to produce. All this during an age when ultra-high-budget blockbusters are being rumored to be fading from public interest. Of course, we are only one year removed from Tom Cruise's TOP GUN: MAVERICK being credited with 'saving cinema', so stay on alert for a 'sky is falling' panic. McQuarrie co-wrote the script with Erik Jendresen (\"Band of Brothers\"), and they remain faithful to the characters and storylines established by the TV series creator, Bruce Geller.There may never have been an actor more suited to a recurring role than Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt (Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones might be the closest). The story itself is fairly straightforward, even if the item being chased often feels like a MacGuffin. Your questioning of how a 'simple' spy-thriller can be effective is understandable, yet it's fascinating to watch as Ethan Hunt's mission in life as an agent is evaluated, as is the cost he's paid as a man. Providing a contemporary theme, the obscure object of desire is an all-powerful key (actually two parts of a key) based on controlling an all-encompassing Artificial Intelligence (AI).In a twist on a familiar theme (and a classic comedy film), we have Airports, Trains, and EVs, the latter being a tiny Fiat with handcuffs. Still, the car chase is everything we might hope, while the high-tech facial search in the airport sequence delivers the thrills for techie viewers, and the train sparring occurs inside as well as on top. And lest you be worried, there are enough Cruise sprint scenes here to put CHARIOTS OF FIRE to shame.Familiar faces include Ethan Hunt's team of Luther (Ving Rhames, who along with Cruise, has appeared in all 7 MI films), Benji (Simon Pegg), and Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). It's nice to again see (and hear) Henry Czerny as Kittridge, Vanessa Kirby as arms dealer The White Widow, and Esai Morales - as Gabriel, the required villain in search of the same key as our good guys. New faces include Haylee Atwell as master pickpocket Grace, whose soul may or may not be beyond salvation; Cary Elwes as agency director Denlinger; Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis as officers after rogue Hunt; and Pom Klementieff as a hired assassin.The stunt work here is outstanding, and of course, Tom Cruise is renowned for personally handling many of the most breathtaking acts - the most memorable one here being his riding of a motorcycle off a cliff. This stunt has a 'making of' video that's been available for a while. As movie goers, we've never seen anything like it. This part one was originally scheduled for release in 2021 (thanks a lot, COVID), and now Part Two is set for 2024. It's been 27 years since the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE (1996) with Jon Voight ... Cruise was 34 in that one. This particular mission is the biggest yet, and it would certainly be impossible for the rest of us. It's a mission that will be closed out in Part Two, and simultaneously bring an end to Cruise's remarkable run as Ethan Hunt.Opening July 12, 2023.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: This movie started out promising but by the end, it just felt like being robbed of two and a half hours. I am a big fan of the MI movies (including MI2, which people seem to hate) and I could appreciate this movie for the few scenes that it did right, but it treats the audience like idiots in its bland, repetitive storyline (how many times do we need to hear the words \"the key\" and \"the entity\"? It was as if the writers of this movie just gave up on their jobs when they wrote this. Easily the weakest MI movie ever filmed. It had me staring at my watch every 20 minutes. As others have mentioned, the character development in this movie is also truly awful. I have barely any interest in seeing Part Two of Dead Reckoning at this point. The high scores this movie is getting absolutely baffle me. This movie by no means deserves a score higher than a 6 or a 6.5.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Basically, this movie is big, loud, and stupid.Definitely TOO loud, in fact. The music attempts to turn even the most minor scene into some sort of heart-pounding climax.There are endless ridiculous fights in which Tom Cruise is predictably unstoppable, no matter how many opponents he's up against. Slim girls get to beat up multiple men. (Emily Blunt was right when, commenting on a fight in \"Sicario\" in which, refreshingly, she loses to a bigger guy, she noted that Hollywood fight scenes in which 110-pound women whip larger males are \"so cheesy.\")The dull, tepid, way-too-pretty villain is, implausibly, a formidable fighter but sure doesn't look like one. An action movie is only as good as its villain is evil; this guy looks like a French fashion mogul.He and Cruise fight on top of -- wait for it -- a moving train! Haven't we seen that ridiculous sort of thing a hundred times before?The tediously overcomplicated plot makes it hard to keep track of who's on which side, nor do we care. Apparently, as is usual these days, we're supposed to root against the U. S. government.In all scenes involving conversations, virtually EVERY line is merely plot exposition in which characters tell us, in stilted dialogue, what's going on, what's supposed to happen, and how we're supposed to feel.The much-touted parachute jump is actually disappointing. It's over quite fast, and its main source of interest is that, if you've seen the promotional video, you know that Cruise himself actually made that jump.The only truly enjoyable sequence -- the cleverly worked-out rescue attempts on the falling train -- comes at the end, after nearly two and a half hours of empty cartoonish nonsense...Including, of course, an overlong cartoonish car chase, obligatory in dumb summer movies.\n",

It feels huge the whole time however I must say I while the set pieces were stellar, the hand to hand combat scenes were not great and a big step down from the last film (Fallout).Thebeginning is slow with a lot of expository being dumped (more than you'd usually see) but once it gets going it is pretty nonstop.This is a good chapter and Haley Atwell shines but it is nowhere near my favorite of the series.7/10Mi rankingsMi6 Fallout\n",

            "Skipping non-numeric rating: 'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part I (M:I7) is another strong entry in the action/spy series, with Ethan (Cruise) looking slightly older, but not less determined to save the world. I believe the sequel to this film will be his last outing - but we'll see. This time, there's some Skynet-like sentient-AI that's manipulating nefarious types to take over the world, so the IMF team are out to get the two halves of key that can stop it.Isla (Ferguson), Benji (Pegg) and Luther (Rhames) are back, as well as CIA boss Kittridge (Czerny), with Grace (Atwell), a thief, being the newcomer. The bad guys that keep thwarting them are Gabriel (Morales) from Ethan's past, and Paris (Klementieff). The consistency of having McQuarrie as director of the two previous films helps, with everything feeling assured and this working as a really solid follow-up to 'Fallout'.There's some funny moments, some sincere ones, and some of Ethan running, as contractually-obliged. The whole final scene on the train is excellent, with so many things happening, but there's plenty of good set-pieces throughout, including a good car chase. However, the piece-de-resistance is the motorbike off the cliff into a BASE jump is something else. The fact Cruise did it for real, multiple times, is crazy and inspiring.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Man.... I wish I loved this movie more than I did. Don't get me wrong, it's a solid action movie with jaw-dropping stunts (some of the best in the series), but as a Mission: Impossible movie, it felt like a small step backward for the franchise. Fallout had mind-blowing action sequences and stunt work, along with developing Ethan's relationship with Ilsa, providing closure with Julia, showing the lengths Ethan would go to protect those closest to him, and battling an imposing villain. Dead Reckoning: Part One stretches the movie across two films only to seemingly showcase action spectacle after action spectacle while sacrificing character development. Characters I have grown to love over a decade of films felt sidelined, ignored, or wasted. Hayley Atwell's new character chewed up most of the screen time, and while she was fantastic, I wanted to see more of the original team. The new villain had an inconsistent ability that confused more than intimidated. There were some important emotional moments that I just didn't feel the weight of when I definitely should have. Part Two might tie everything together and make me enjoy Part One more in retrospect, but unfortunately, I left wanting more from this one.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Just got out of seeing this movie. I am really disappointed that they totally killed off the potential relationship between Ethan and Ilsa. I am totally OK with her dying but the way that they did it and how anti-climactic it was after building up her character so much in the previous two films. Just seems like she would've deserved a better death than that. Also, what was the point of showing the two characters getting closer to each other, and in the last film, his ex-wife, basically giving them permission to move forward when you're just going to kill her off like that. Honestly, Rebecca Ferguson revised this franchise two movies ago and I think killing off her character was a big mistake. Even in the scenes that she's in it doesn't even seem like she's playing the same person. I wonder if they wrote her out of the movie because she's too busy with the rest of her work. Hayley Atwell's character doesn't make sense to me either. Just put her in the IMF because she can pick some pockets? This all seems forced. Maybe most won't agree, but I think this development totally ruined the movie for me.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Just saw this one in a theatre, and boy... what an adrenaline rush it is. The latest Mission Impossible features some of the most incredible stunts ever put to camera. The story is absolutely exhilarating and continues to bring new life to a veteran movie franchise. The sheer scale of this movie is epic, and with every twist and turn of the movie, you cannot help but marvel at the incredible sets used to bring this movie to life. Such a movie begs to be seen on the biggest screen possible where you can truly feel the grandeur of the film. Tom Cruise has once again delivered one of the best movies of the year, and I cannot recommend that you see it enough!\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: To me, a new M:I film is an event. From Part 4 onwards, they've been spectacular (all 10/10's).There's some good stuff here for sure, and overall it's a solid 8, but it's simply not as good as previous entries.I kept noticing that a lot of scenes had just 2 or 3 people in them, and I kept imagining the crew all masked up, as well as the cast when the camera wasn't on them. It can't be easy to make a huge movie like this during a pandemic, but it definitely shows.The A. I. plot is quite good, and Hunt's as-yet-unknown backstory quite intriguing, but the whole story basically revolves around: \"I've got the key, now she's got the key, now he's got the key\" etc. So much pick-pocketing.Also, I really wish they hadn't ruined the motorcycle jump in the promos. If you've seen the promo, you've seen the scene. There are really only 3 or 4 action sequences, and nothing we haven't really seen before. I actually enjoyed the first desert shoot-out the best.And- oh!- the exposition! There's a scene near the beginning that reminded me of a Neil Breen(!) movie, where powerful people sit in a room and just spout buzz words like \"nuclear war,\" \"economic collapse,\" \"dogs and cats living together\" etc.THAT said, it's still an 8/10. Tom always gives it his best, the rest of the cast is good (especially all four female leads) and I thought the added humour with Hunt's character was a nice touch. I'd rather watch this ten times over than any blatant cyncial Disney cash-grab.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Good God. I feel ashamed for approaching this film with a modicum of doubt that Tom would still be able to deliver. Unbelievably, this epic actually manages to top the brilliant Fallout. Tom is literally going to die if he keeps doing these stunts. The motorbike sequence is utterly ludicrous. Intriguing plot with actual stakes and some familiar faces ably supported by brilliant new allies and villains. Sets up Part II perfectly with a sensational finale that homages Back to the Future 3, MI:1 and Speed. It is funny, action packed, polished and exhilarating. Harrison was great last week, but Tom is still the King. 9/10.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: I was lucky to be able to watch this 4 days before its official release in Czech Republic as a pre-premiere (didn't know such a thing existed) and it was the first time I've felt real excitement to go watch a film at the cinema in ages thanks to the recent genius combination of Fallout and Top Gun 2.I know what they were trying to do with this film. Bringing Kittridge back and a convoluted train finale all harked back to the 1st movie that sparked it all off. Explaining that convoluted storyline along the way harks back to the criticisms made about that same first film.The sky jump stunt was an attempt to beat the stunts from Tom Cruise in previous installments that have now become a beloved trademark of the franchise.But this film unfortunately overall is most reminiscent of the second installment which was Tom Cruise centric and lacked any real impossible mission requiring teamwork, real stakes and ingenious problem solving.In fact, it could have even been intentional that this film reminds the viewer of Mission Impossible 2. The photos in the film of past Ethan Hunt when searching for present Ethan Hunt show him with his longer hair as he looked in that second film.Ultimately, I expected the story to be way better than what we get in this instalment.There are 2 guys that keep appearing at each scene trying to catch Ethan which seems a very cheap simple story.And the very simple plot is explained in long scenes to make it seem way more complicated that it actually is (people complained there should be more explanation in the first film, but at least the plot in the first film actually required brain power), and I have to say that some of the acting is quite poor at times, not helped by some rather cheesy lines in the script, including the lines and accents in the opening Russian submarine sequence.There is also not that much action. 3 main action sequences for a close to 3 hour movie, which are the desert shoot out at the beginning, the Venice car chase, and the train crash at the end.I thought the alleyway fight scene, which some have praised, was really quite subpar and not very enthralling.The best action scene is the Venice car chase because it is genuinely funny (yes, because it is excellently laugh out loud funny, but not in any way tense); I never had the feeling that I was on the edge of my seat.The motorcycle sky jump scene was a major disappointment after the hype because if you didn't know Cruise actually did do that stunt, they used so much CGI that people would just assume it was computer generated. It actually reminded me of Pierce Brosnan's riding the tsunami in Die Another Day (sorry Tom! The stunt is still awesome!).The same for the train at the end. I know they actually made that train, and probably actually threw it off a bridge, but it doesn't look real. Though it is a long action finale and very fun to watch, for me the lack of realism takes away any tension. You are enjoying it for its visual value, but again not feeling any 'wow' factor or tension.At the end of Fallout, for example, you really felt Ethan Hunt was battered, bruised, worn out and still fighting to save humanity. There is none of that.The most tragic thing about this movie is that, unlike in the best of the previous films, we're back to the team being irrelevant in this one. Benji and Luther don't actually do very much.And poor Ilsa. Fallout ended with Ethan's ex-wife essentially giving him permission to move on and be with Ilsa.The relationship between Ilsa and Hunt had been built up over two excellent movies - Rogue Nation and Fallout - and in this film she says almost nothing, looks grumpy and sad all the time, and dies in an anticlimactic fight that is literally spelt out to the audience as a way to replace her with newcomer Grace.Grace, played by Hayley Atwell, is good. A likeable character and a capable actress, but I don't get the story unless Rebecca Ferguson said she wants out the franchise.The film is all about chasing \"the key.\" No twists. No high stakes. There is virtually no grittiness in this outing. It feels very light.Ultimately I was hoping to enjoy a quality film in the franchise. A movie like Oblivion, Edge of Tomorrow, Fallout, Top Gun 2 or American Made that you can show to anyone and say these are recent really high quality films starring this guy called Tom Cruise.This is not one of those films.It is more like The Mummy. It is better than Mission Impossible 2 but not better than any of the others in the franchise.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One confirms that Mission Impossible is the best franchise currently going and possibly ever made. A 2 hour 43 minute adrenaline rush that contains some of the best action sequences put to film, embarrasses the majority of the competition out there and sets the stage for a magnificent part 2 whilst still being a satisfying adventure in its own right.This is possibly the most open and obvious a Mission film has been with its deeper meaning for cinema and what aspect of Cruise's career is being dissected this time with a film that focuses on Ethan's relationship with women and basically outright declares AI to be a soulless monster and how the human element is always needed (perfect film to release during a writer's strike).Tom Cruise is perfect as Ethan Hunt and the strongest aspect this time round is when the film explores what made Ethan who he is and reminds you he genuinely cares about his team but that comes at a cost. Physically, the madman is still going strong with his stunts, driving a bike off a cliff in truly breathtaking fashion.Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg and Rebecca Ferguson remain the best IMF team and all play to their strengths here. The longer this series goes on the more authentic their growing friendship feels. Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis get more than expected and their buddy cop antics are a lot of fun.With Esai Morales' charismatic yet terrifying Gabriel and Pom Klementieff's terrific henchman of few words, this franchise finally has more good villains than bad. The return of Henry Czerny as Kittridge is glorious and he remains as gleefully despicable as his first appearance.The best new addition is easily Hayley Atwell. She plays a type of character never seen before in these films which makes her character and dynamic with Cruise fresh in comparison to everyone who's come before and their chemistry is magnetic. Instantaneous from the second they interact.Christopher McQuarrie's direction is phenomenal. The action sequences are suitably practical (this is how you spend $290 million), and the camera gets as close to the action as humanly possible, he remains one of the best in the business working at this scale. There's plenty of canted angles as a nice homage to De Palma's original and it helps give this one its own style in comparison to McQuarrie's previous entries.The pacing is really impressive with the film feeling like it's in a perpetual third act from its first airport heist (which is so much fun). Lorne Balfe does the music once again and yet again it's a highlight of the film, he knows how to elevate everything so well and really hammers home the emotional beats.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Ethan Hunt has left the mere secret agent status and has ascended to the all living perfect messiah.There is so much wrong with this movie, which seriously pains me because I seriously love this series. The mission impossible movies have steadily become more convoluted and more stupidly written. This film reaches the peak of absurdity, feeling more like an over the top fast and furious movie. All foolish action, cheap parlor tricks to pull the heart strings (empty relationships), horrible writing, poor plot development.I mean seriously what ever happened to show don't tell?! This is becoming rather ridiculous.*convoluted villain dialogue*\n",
            "\"So what you're telling me is you plan to establish a new world order if you get that key and if someone stops you that would be bad?!\"Has Ethan Hunt suddenly become this vanilla James Bond? With the Bond girl cycling through every few films? Lazy writing. Not natural feeling. Forced. BlighIt pains me to give this so low.The truth is, this movie is mindless entertaining action. Tom Cruise delivers on some awesome stunts (seldom compared to other MI films). It's not horrible. It's fun entertainment, but a scour on the (in my opinion) reputable authentic feeling mission impossible series.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: So you probably watched IM 6 and said, they can't make it any better can they? Or Top Gun 2, guess again, this is an adrenaline action movie with a good story, well written, action scenes that just blow you away, not a boring moment and you are on the edge of your seat all the time, this is how you make movies! Tom Cruise did it again, WOW!! It's an exhausting ride he takes you on, man I forgot to eat my popcorn and by the time i finally wanted some my wife had eaten all of it, but hey I was so immersed into the movie that time stood still and i forgot everything around me.Go and see it, this one gets my full recommendation, the only reason it's not a 10 is due to the fact it's not a completely new type of movie, however this one is done as a good action movie should be made, i don't see how they could have made it better, I really can't, go watch it and have a good time while you do it, it will put a big smile on your face that's for sure.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Am huge fan of MI franchise. The best part about all MI movies were how they plan and pull off an impossible mission. Thus I am quite disappointed on how this mission never seemed too difficult , let alone impossible.Action was okay. Car chase was funny, but not exciting. Jumping off the cliff seemed forced to me. Why would you keep driving uphill when you can take short cuts to reach the train. It wasn't even a fast train. The key kept being stolen from pockets too many times which makes you wonder how lazy the scripting was. Kill old gf to make new gf was also lazy writing.Unlike other MIs, Ethan had no single smart move or plan. It felt more like let's go and see what happens.Am not sure how MI fans ignored all these weaknesses and gave this film 8+ rating.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: This was a great movie. However, it lost a star from me for making the audience believe Ilsa is dead. They've spent two films building up Ilsa as being Ethan's equal, and hinted at an eventual romance. She's been able to fight off multiple men bare-handed yet she meets her demise by one guy when she has a sword? Then they brush past her death like it means nothing, only for her to be replaced by a new woman. I thought it was a huge disservice to the character.I know Rebecca Ferguson is very busy so she might have asked to leave, but I'm hoping this isn't the end for my favorite character in these films. She deserves a happy ending, or at least a better death than the one she received in this movie. It really took me out of the rest of the film. Hopefully, we'll see her again in Part Two.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Remember that classic MI scene where they broke in at CIA, and Cruise was hanging from the ceiling using wires? It's not a huge setpiece, but that scene is a nailbiting example of ingenious problem solving.In 'Dead Reckoning' there's none of that. Here it's keys changing hands every 10 minutes that is suppose to pass as suspense. And of course the only true selling point: the stunts performed by Tom Cruise.But I want and expect more than that.A large part of the film is devoted to people sitting or standing in a room, explaining what the plot is. Endless talking and explaining. We are told in several scenes the same information we just heard. Worst one is Benji, who is merely there to repeat things for someone in the cast, to make sure everyone in the audience knows what is going on. That is sloppy writing. One of the biggest no-no's as a screenwriter is resolving to \"so what you are saying is, that...\" info sharing. Benji does this all the time. And he is as incompetent as usual. And he is supposed to be a part of a small and unique team that is saving the world? Really?I hope MI:8 isn't just another Tom Cruise stunt reel where it looks like they make the story up as the go along, as long as all marks are checked in the end (running, face swapping, dealing with heights etc), and where character development takes a backseat. Bigger is not always better. And the action ALWAYS has to serve the story, not the other way around.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: After the first 30 minutes that promised an intellectual action thriller, the film starts its nosedive into mediocrity by introducing a thief who constantly indulges in disloyalty, for petty gains, towards the IMF and Hunt, but is held in high regards by Hunt. For the life of me, I couldn't understand why. The film also doesn't bother with it.Neither is it concerned with the so called action set pieces. _Fallout_ had plethora of those, one after the other, tied together by a cogent story line. For all its hype, it has 2-3 in a run time of close to 160 minutes, which tested my patience.Reading it's critics' reviews post viewing make me feel as if they have been written by the Entity, the AI behemoth at the center of this. The perceived entertainment value implied by them is not even remotely connected with the reality.It is no wonder that it is faltering at the US box office. It is no Top Gun- Maverick. Crowds are going to turn up, especially outside the US, because of Cruise's star power. But I don't believe this will please most of them.Disappointing.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: An absolute masterclass in producing an enjoyable action movie. Cinematography was great, the story was paced extremely well, and the casting of ALL roles was absolutely perfect.Cruise, Pegg and Rhames were awesome as always, Whigham and Davis were great additions, but the power quartet of Ferguson, Atwell, Klementieff and Kirby, really went above and beyond in making this movie perfect. Not to mention the chilling confidence of Morales as Gabriel, who practically oozes tangible danger.From the pre-opening credits scene to the final act, if you're like me, you will be on the edge of your seat - especially during any fight scene that involves Ferguson or Klementieff - and whilst there are moments that the tempo slows down to advance the story, it is always completely captivating.The single, solitary, disappointment comes as the credits roll, and you remember you're going to have to wait until next year to see how it ends.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Absolutely superb! Was hoping they could do the impossible and surpass Fallout! And Cruise, McQuarrie and co have accomplished this in spades, delivering the best spy/ action thriller in years.It is a next level masterclass of a film, with everything you would expect from an Mission Impossible film and more.The cast are great, with the new additions adding so much to the usual MI crew. The stunts are performed to the usual high standard and give you that Wow feeling you want, The story is fantastic, leaving you wanting more, setting up Part Two really wellGo see this on the best screen possible.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: It should be impossible to fumble the bag so badly on a nostalgia trip movie like this. Just let Tom Cruise run, do some crazy stunts and play the iconic theme music. But no they gotta drag on for three hours with a meaningless storyline just for it to be one part of an incomplete movie. Like whatever happened to movie editing? There's no reason for this movie to be this long and a lot of the content is completely unnecessary to move the plot forward. I don't expect MI movies to have watertight logic but then atleast the writers shouldn't twist themselves into knots thinking they're making a deeper movie than they are, the sooner these movie trends with AI, quantum space tunneling, multiverse nonsense end the better it is for good storylines.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: This latest Mission: Impossible movie is a slam dunk that needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible. Tom Cruise certainly knows how to make a movie. In another universe Cruse could have been Iron Man and I always felt that his aggression with the Mission: Impossible franchise was his way of making up for that. That's probably why the dialog in this movie felt like Ethan Hawk was captain America or something and they are going up against a Bonafede supervillain in the form of an A. I system. As far as I'm concern the best villain of the franchise snice the late and great Phillip Seymour Huffman.The Avengers Assemble as franchise regulars Simon Pegg as Dunn and Ving Rhimes, who I say with glee, started this franchise with Cruse as Luther, make their return as IMF agents. Rebecca Ferguson reprises her role from the last movie and Haley Atwell is in the movie as well, but none of this makes me as happy as Ving still being in the franchise.The action sequences are so good in this picture. It was worth having to stay in me seat for almost three hours just so they can add a little more action in-between the Hero's journey dialogue.And this is just part one!? Part two has some big shoes to fill!\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: I love Tom Cruise movies, but this one feels pretty contrived. Beyond the plot, Grace was the biggest detriment to the movie. The character started out amusing but her shtick became insufferable and Ethan's infatuation idiotic. How they handled Ilsa feels both rushed and cheap, with no emotional weight felt. The biggest stunt was spoiled beforehand which I suppose did its job in getting me in the seat, but totally ruins the moment in film. The final act also lacked any tension and was honestly a little boring - there wasn't any real cleverness.Still, it was humorous throughout, had a good amount of charm and the production value is evident. That's enough for me to be above average but it's unlikely I'll watch the followup in theater.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: As a hardout Mission fan. I can confirm 5 years was definitely worth the wait. The film is extremally charming and filled with exciting humor, action and story-telling. Tom and Hayley really bring the film so much joy and create wonderful chemistry. The chase scene in Rome puts you on the edge of your seat and nothing prepares you for the daring things Tom and Hayley pull off in the train sequence.. Tom really understands the action genre and did not disappoint with this film. There is a perfect blend between foundation building for the story and the action sequences. The film is a beautiful set up to the part 2 coming next year.. Brilliant Watch 100/10.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Straight up Dead Reckoning Part 1 was fine. I think it's the weakest out of the last four instalments.I can't put my finger on one exact thing but it just felt a little underdone compared to the last few M:I and was expecting big things the whole movie. It was a combination of things like the acting felt a little weak I guess, the script was just fine, the action was decent but not great compared to other M:I and to the likes of John Wick that I'm now used to. The plot with the A. I is nothing new but it's always still interesting and especially at a time in the real world where the advancements seem to be heating up but the whole pickpocketing the key for 2 hours also got boring so fast. Too many cliches started piling up. The hand to hand combat was some of the weakest stuff I've seen it a while especially the Venice bridge scene, it looked awful, like I could see the choreography. The best scene for me was the desert storm at the start which really had my attention but everything after that seemed just average.I don't know if everyone else is now completely over their only trick being having someone go as someone else with these masks. It's so boring to me now and at a stage I'm kinda rolling my eyes. I really hope the machine blowing a fuse means we have seen the last of them.Tom Cruise is awesome with the stunts he does and will always have respect for the things him doing them but I really wish they didn't show the motorbike cliff jump scene in the trailer. What you see in the trailer is literally the whole stunt, don't get me wrong it's truly impressive but they showed the whole thing and just completely killed it for me.I'm slightly bummed with this one and just coming off seeing Indian Jones and having a lot more fun watching that. I don't care about runtimes but you have to have me sucked in and the whole time, I felt the time...People will love this movie but M:I may have fizzled out with me a bit after this one.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Greetings again from the darkness. The challenge in continuing the \"Mission: Impossible\" franchise is that fans expect each entry to be \"bigger\" and more awe-inspiring than the last. With the seventh film in the series, and the third straight he has directed, writer-director Christopher McQuarrie and superstar actor and daredevil Tom Cruise have managed to accomplish what seemed unlikely ... they have delivered Ethan Hunt's biggest and grandest mission yet. Prepare to be awed by the action.You should know that this is \"Part One\" and it runs 163 minutes, a full hour longer than most movies, and exponentially more expensive to produce. All this during an age when ultra-high-budget blockbusters are being rumored to be fading from public interest. Of course, we are only one year removed from Tom Cruise's TOP GUN: MAVERICK being credited with 'saving cinema', so stay on alert for a 'sky is falling' panic. McQuarrie co-wrote the script with Erik Jendresen (\"Band of Brothers\"), and they remain faithful to the characters and storylines established by the TV series creator, Bruce Geller.There may never have been an actor more suited to a recurring role than Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt (Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones might be the closest). The story itself is fairly straightforward, even if the item being chased often feels like a MacGuffin. Your questioning of how a 'simple' spy-thriller can be effective is understandable, yet it's fascinating to watch as Ethan Hunt's mission in life as an agent is evaluated, as is the cost he's paid as a man. Providing a contemporary theme, the obscure object of desire is an all-powerful key (actually two parts of a key) based on controlling an all-encompassing Artificial Intelligence (AI).In a twist on a familiar theme (and a classic comedy film), we have Airports, Trains, and EVs, the latter being a tiny Fiat with handcuffs. Still, the car chase is everything we might hope, while the high-tech facial search in the airport sequence delivers the thrills for techie viewers, and the train sparring occurs inside as well as on top. And lest you be worried, there are enough Cruise sprint scenes here to put CHARIOTS OF FIRE to shame.Familiar faces include Ethan Hunt's team of Luther (Ving Rhames, who along with Cruise, has appeared in all 7 MI films), Benji (Simon Pegg), and Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). It's nice to again see (and hear) Henry Czerny as Kittridge, Vanessa Kirby as arms dealer The White Widow, and Esai Morales - as Gabriel, the required villain in search of the same key as our good guys. New faces include Haylee Atwell as master pickpocket Grace, whose soul may or may not be beyond salvation; Cary Elwes as agency director Denlinger; Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis as officers after rogue Hunt; and Pom Klementieff as a hired assassin.The stunt work here is outstanding, and of course, Tom Cruise is renowned for personally handling many of the most breathtaking acts - the most memorable one here being his riding of a motorcycle off a cliff. This stunt has a 'making of' video that's been available for a while. As movie goers, we've never seen anything like it. This part one was originally scheduled for release in 2021 (thanks a lot, COVID), and now Part Two is set for 2024. It's been 27 years since the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE (1996) with Jon Voight ... Cruise was 34 in that one. This particular mission is the biggest yet, and it would certainly be impossible for the rest of us. It's a mission that will be closed out in Part Two, and simultaneously bring an end to Cruise's remarkable run as Ethan Hunt.Opening July 12, 2023.\n",

I am a big fan of the MI movies (including MI2, which people seem to hate) and I could appreciate this movie for the few scenes that it did right, but it treats the audience like idiots in its bland, repetitive storyline (how many times do we need to hear the words \"the key\" and \"the entity\"? It was as if the writers of this movie just gave up on their jobs when they wrote this. Easily the weakest MI movie ever filmed. It had me staring at my watch every 20 minutes. As others have mentioned, the character development in this movie is also truly awful. I have barely any interest in seeing Part Two of Dead Reckoning at this point. The high scores this movie is getting absolutely baffle me. This movie by no means deserves a score higher than a 6 or a 6.5.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Basically, this movie is big, loud, and stupid.Definitely TOO loud, in fact. The music attempts to turn even the most minor scene into some sort of heart-pounding climax.There are endless ridiculous fights in which Tom Cruise is predictably unstoppable, no matter how many opponents he's up against. Slim girls get to beat up multiple men. (Emily Blunt was right when, commenting on a fight in \"Sicario\" in which, refreshingly, she loses to a bigger guy, she noted that Hollywood fight scenes in which 110-pound women whip larger males are \"so cheesy.\")The dull, tepid, way-too-pretty villain is, implausibly, a formidable fighter but sure doesn't look like one. An action movie is only as good as its villain is evil; this guy looks like a French fashion mogul.He and Cruise fight on top of -- wait for it -- a moving train! Haven't we seen that ridiculous sort of thing a hundred times before?The tediously overcomplicated plot makes it hard to keep track of who's on which side, nor do we care. Apparently, as is usual these days, we're supposed to root against the U. S. government.In all scenes involving conversations, virtually EVERY line is merely plot exposition in which characters tell us, in stilted dialogue, what's going on, what's supposed to happen, and how we're supposed to feel.The much-touted parachute jump is actually disappointing. It's over quite fast, and its main source of interest is that, if you've seen the promotional video, you know that Cruise himself actually made that jump.The only truly enjoyable sequence -- the cleverly worked-out rescue attempts on the falling train -- comes at the end, after nearly two and a half hours of empty cartoonish nonsense...Including, of course, an overlong cartoonish car chase, obligatory in dumb summer movies.\n",

I believe the sequel to this film will be his last outing - but we'll see. This time, there's some Skynet-like sentient-AI that's manipulating nefarious types to take over the world, so the IMF team are out to get the two halves of key that can stop it.Isla (Ferguson), Benji (Pegg) and Luther (Rhames) are back, as well as CIA boss Kittridge (Czerny), with Grace (Atwell), a thief, being the newcomer. The bad guys that keep thwarting them are Gabriel (Morales) from Ethan's past, and Paris (Klementieff). The consistency of having McQuarrie as director of the two previous films helps, with everything feeling assured and this working as a really solid follow-up to 'Fallout'.There's some funny moments, some sincere ones, and some of Ethan running, as contractually-obliged. The whole final scene on the train is excellent, with so many things happening, but there's plenty of good set-pieces throughout, including a good car chase. However, the piece-de-resistance is the motorbike off the cliff into a BASE jump is something else. The fact Cruise did it for real, multiple times, is crazy and inspiring.\n",

Fallout had mind-blowing action sequences and stunt work, along with developing Ethan's relationship with Ilsa, providing closure with Julia, showing the lengths Ethan would go to protect those closest to him, and battling an imposing villain. Dead Reckoning: Part One stretches the movie across two films only to seemingly showcase action spectacle after action spectacle while sacrificing character development. Characters I have grown to love over a decade of films felt sidelined, ignored, or wasted. Hayley Atwell's new character chewed up most of the screen time, and while she was fantastic, I wanted to see more of the original team. The new villain had an inconsistent ability that confused more than intimidated. There were some important emotional moments that I just didn't feel the weight of when I definitely should have. Part Two might tie everything together and make me enjoy Part One more in retrospect, but unfortunately, I left wanting more from this one.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Just got out of seeing this movie. I am really disappointed that they totally killed off the potential relationship between Ethan and Ilsa. I am totally OK with her dying but the way that they did it and how anti-climactic it was after building up her character so much in the previous two films. Just seems like she would've deserved a better death than that. Also, what was the point of showing the two characters getting closer to each other, and in the last film, his ex-wife, basically giving them permission to move forward when you're just going to kill her off like that. Honestly, Rebecca Ferguson revised this franchise two movies ago and I think killing off her character was a big mistake. Even in the scenes that she's in it doesn't even seem like she's playing the same person. I wonder if they wrote her out of the movie because she's too busy with the rest of her work. Hayley Atwell's character doesn't make sense to me either. Just put her in the IMF because she can pick some pockets? This all seems forced. Maybe most won't agree, but I think this development totally ruined the movie for me.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Just saw this one in a theatre, and boy... what an adrenaline rush it is. The latest Mission Impossible features some of the most incredible stunts ever put to camera. The story is absolutely exhilarating and continues to bring new life to a veteran movie franchise. The sheer scale of this movie is epic, and with every twist and turn of the movie, you cannot help but marvel at the incredible sets used to bring this movie to life. Such a movie begs to be seen on the biggest screen possible where you can truly feel the grandeur of the film. Tom Cruise has once again delivered one of the best movies of the year, and I cannot recommend that you see it enough!\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: To me, a new M:I film is an event. From Part 4 onwards, they've been spectacular (all 10/10's).There's some good stuff here for sure, and overall it's a solid 8, but it's simply not as good as previous entries.I kept noticing that a lot of scenes had just 2 or 3 people in them, and I kept imagining the crew all masked up, as well as the cast when the camera wasn't on them. It can't be easy to make a huge movie like this during a pandemic, but it definitely shows.The A. I. plot is quite good, and Hunt's as-yet-unknown backstory quite intriguing, but the whole story basically revolves around: \"I've got the key, now she's got the key, now he's got the key\" etc. So much pick-pocketing.Also, I really wish they hadn't ruined the motorcycle jump in the promos. If you've seen the promo, you've seen the scene. There are really only 3 or 4 action sequences, and nothing we haven't really seen before. I actually enjoyed the first desert shoot-out the best.And- oh!- the exposition! There's a scene near the beginning that reminded me of a Neil Breen(!) movie, where powerful people sit in a room and just spout buzz words like \"nuclear war,\" \"economic collapse,\" \"dogs and cats living together\" etc.THAT said, it's still an 8/10. Tom always gives it his best, the rest of the cast is good (especially all four female leads) and I thought the added humour with Hunt's character was a nice touch. I'd rather watch this ten times over than any blatant cyncial Disney cash-grab.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Good God. I feel ashamed for approaching this film with a modicum of doubt that Tom would still be able to deliver. Unbelievably, this epic actually manages to top the brilliant Fallout. Tom is literally going to die if he keeps doing these stunts. The motorbike sequence is utterly ludicrous. Intriguing plot with actual stakes and some familiar faces ably supported by brilliant new allies and villains. Sets up Part II perfectly with a sensational finale that homages Back to the Future 3, MI:1 and Speed. It is funny, action packed, polished and exhilarating. Harrison was great last week, but Tom is still the King. 9/10.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: I was lucky to be able to watch this 4 days before its official release in Czech Republic as a pre-premiere (didn't know such a thing existed) and it was the first time I've felt real excitement to go watch a film at the cinema in ages thanks to the recent genius combination of Fallout and Top Gun 2.I know what they were trying to do with this film. Bringing Kittridge back and a convoluted train finale all harked back to the 1st movie that sparked it all off. Explaining that convoluted storyline along the way harks back to the criticisms made about that same first film.The sky jump stunt was an attempt to beat the stunts from Tom Cruise in previous installments that have now become a beloved trademark of the franchise.But this film unfortunately overall is most reminiscent of the second installment which was Tom Cruise centric and lacked any real impossible mission requiring teamwork, real stakes and ingenious problem solving.In fact, it could have even been intentional that this film reminds the viewer of Mission Impossible 2. The photos in the film of past Ethan Hunt when searching for present Ethan Hunt show him with his longer hair as he looked in that second film.Ultimately, I expected the story to be way better than what we get in this instalment.There are 2 guys that keep appearing at each scene trying to catch Ethan which seems a very cheap simple story.And the very simple plot is explained in long scenes to make it seem way more complicated that it actually is (people complained there should be more explanation in the first film, but at least the plot in the first film actually required brain power), and I have to say that some of the acting is quite poor at times, not helped by some rather cheesy lines in the script, including the lines and accents in the opening Russian submarine sequence.There is also not that much action. 3 main action sequences for a close to 3 hour movie, which are the desert shoot out at the beginning, the Venice car chase, and the train crash at the end.I thought the alleyway fight scene, which some have praised, was really quite subpar and not very enthralling.The best action scene is the Venice car chase because it is genuinely funny (yes, because it is excellently laugh out loud funny, but not in any way tense); I never had the feeling that I was on the edge of my seat.The motorcycle sky jump scene was a major disappointment after the hype because if you didn't know Cruise actually did do that stunt, they used so much CGI that people would just assume it was computer generated. It actually reminded me of Pierce Brosnan's riding the tsunami in Die Another Day (sorry Tom! The stunt is still awesome!).The same for the train at the end. I know they actually made that train, and probably actually threw it off a bridge, but it doesn't look real. Though it is a long action finale and very fun to watch, for me the lack of realism takes away any tension. You are enjoying it for its visual value, but again not feeling any 'wow' factor or tension.At the end of Fallout, for example, you really felt Ethan Hunt was battered, bruised, worn out and still fighting to save humanity. There is none of that.The most tragic thing about this movie is that, unlike in the best of the previous films, we're back to the team being irrelevant in this one. Benji and Luther don't actually do very much.And poor Ilsa. Fallout ended with Ethan's ex-wife essentially giving him permission to move on and be with Ilsa.The relationship between Ilsa and Hunt had been built up over two excellent movies - Rogue Nation and Fallout - and in this film she says almost nothing, looks grumpy and sad all the time, and dies in an anticlimactic fight that is literally spelt out to the audience as a way to replace her with newcomer Grace.Grace, played by Hayley Atwell, is good. A likeable character and a capable actress, but I don't get the story unless Rebecca Ferguson said she wants out the franchise.The film is all about chasing \"the key.\" No twists. No high stakes. There is virtually no grittiness in this outing. It feels very light.Ultimately I was hoping to enjoy a quality film in the franchise. A movie like Oblivion, Edge of Tomorrow, Fallout, Top Gun 2 or American Made that you can show to anyone and say these are recent really high quality films starring this guy called Tom Cruise.This is not one of those films.It is more like The Mummy. It is better than Mission Impossible 2 but not better than any of the others in the franchise.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One confirms that Mission Impossible is the best franchise currently going and possibly ever made. A 2 hour 43 minute adrenaline rush that contains some of the best action sequences put to film, embarrasses the majority of the competition out there and sets the stage for a magnificent part 2 whilst still being a satisfying adventure in its own right.This is possibly the most open and obvious a Mission film has been with its deeper meaning for cinema and what aspect of Cruise's career is being dissected this time with a film that focuses on Ethan's relationship with women and basically outright declares AI to be a soulless monster and how the human element is always needed (perfect film to release during a writer's strike).Tom Cruise is perfect as Ethan Hunt and the strongest aspect this time round is when the film explores what made Ethan who he is and reminds you he genuinely cares about his team but that comes at a cost. Physically, the madman is still going strong with his stunts, driving a bike off a cliff in truly breathtaking fashion.Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg and Rebecca Ferguson remain the best IMF team and all play to their strengths here. The longer this series goes on the more authentic their growing friendship feels. Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis get more than expected and their buddy cop antics are a lot of fun.With Esai Morales' charismatic yet terrifying Gabriel and Pom Klementieff's terrific henchman of few words, this franchise finally has more good villains than bad. The return of Henry Czerny as Kittridge is glorious and he remains as gleefully despicable as his first appearance.The best new addition is easily Hayley Atwell. She plays a type of character never seen before in these films which makes her character and dynamic with Cruise fresh in comparison to everyone who's come before and their chemistry is magnetic. Instantaneous from the second they interact.Christopher McQuarrie's direction is phenomenal. The action sequences are suitably practical (this is how you spend $290 million), and the camera gets as close to the action as humanly possible, he remains one of the best in the business working at this scale. There's plenty of canted angles as a nice homage to De Palma's original and it helps give this one its own style in comparison to McQuarrie's previous entries.The pacing is really impressive with the film feeling like it's in a perpetual third act from its first airport heist (which is so much fun). Lorne Balfe does the music once again and yet again it's a highlight of the film, he knows how to elevate everything so well and really hammers home the emotional beats.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Ethan Hunt has left the mere secret agent status and has ascended to the all living perfect messiah.There is so much wrong with this movie, which seriously pains me because I seriously love this series. The mission impossible movies have steadily become more convoluted and more stupidly written. This film reaches the peak of absurdity, feeling more like an over the top fast and furious movie. All foolish action, cheap parlor tricks to pull the heart strings (empty relationships), horrible writing, poor plot development.I mean seriously what ever happened to show don't tell?! This is becoming rather ridiculous.*convoluted villain dialogue*\n",
            "\"So what you're telling me is you plan to establish a new world order if you get that key and if someone stops you that would be bad?!\"Has Ethan Hunt suddenly become this vanilla James Bond? With the Bond girl cycling through every few films? Lazy writing. Not natural feeling. Forced. BlighIt pains me to give this so low.The truth is, this movie is mindless entertaining action. Tom Cruise delivers on some awesome stunts (seldom compared to other MI films). It's not horrible. It's fun entertainment, but a scour on the (in my opinion) reputable authentic feeling mission impossible series.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: So you probably watched IM 6 and said, they can't make it any better can they? Or Top Gun 2, guess again, this is an adrenaline action movie with a good story, well written, action scenes that just blow you away, not a boring moment and you are on the edge of your seat all the time, this is how you make movies! Tom Cruise did it again, WOW!! It's an exhausting ride he takes you on, man I forgot to eat my popcorn and by the time i finally wanted some my wife had eaten all of it, but hey I was so immersed into the movie that time stood still and i forgot everything around me.Go and see it, this one gets my full recommendation, the only reason it's not a 10 is due to the fact it's not a completely new type of movie, however this one is done as a good action movie should be made, i don't see how they could have made it better, I really can't, go watch it and have a good time while you do it, it will put a big smile on your face that's for sure.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Am huge fan of MI franchise. The best part about all MI movies were how they plan and pull off an impossible mission. Thus I am quite disappointed on how this mission never seemed too difficult , let alone impossible.Action was okay. Car chase was funny, but not exciting. Jumping off the cliff seemed forced to me. Why would you keep driving uphill when you can take short cuts to reach the train. It wasn't even a fast train. The key kept being stolen from pockets too many times which makes you wonder how lazy the scripting was. Kill old gf to make new gf was also lazy writing.Unlike other MIs, Ethan had no single smart move or plan. It felt more like let's go and see what happens.Am not sure how MI fans ignored all these weaknesses and gave this film 8+ rating.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: This was a great movie. However, it lost a star from me for making the audience believe Ilsa is dead. They've spent two films building up Ilsa as being Ethan's equal, and hinted at an eventual romance. She's been able to fight off multiple men bare-handed yet she meets her demise by one guy when she has a sword? Then they brush past her death like it means nothing, only for her to be replaced by a new woman. I thought it was a huge disservice to the character.I know Rebecca Ferguson is very busy so she might have asked to leave, but I'm hoping this isn't the end for my favorite character in these films. She deserves a happy ending, or at least a better death than the one she received in this movie. It really took me out of the rest of the film. Hopefully, we'll see her again in Part Two.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Remember that classic MI scene where they broke in at CIA, and Cruise was hanging from the ceiling using wires? It's not a huge setpiece, but that scene is a nailbiting example of ingenious problem solving.In 'Dead Reckoning' there's none of that. Here it's keys changing hands every 10 minutes that is suppose to pass as suspense. And of course the only true selling point: the stunts performed by Tom Cruise.But I want and expect more than that.A large part of the film is devoted to people sitting or standing in a room, explaining what the plot is. Endless talking and explaining. We are told in several scenes the same information we just heard. Worst one is Benji, who is merely there to repeat things for someone in the cast, to make sure everyone in the audience knows what is going on. That is sloppy writing. One of the biggest no-no's as a screenwriter is resolving to \"so what you are saying is, that...\" info sharing. Benji does this all the time. And he is as incompetent as usual. And he is supposed to be a part of a small and unique team that is saving the world? Really?I hope MI:8 isn't just another Tom Cruise stunt reel where it looks like they make the story up as the go along, as long as all marks are checked in the end (running, face swapping, dealing with heights etc), and where character development takes a backseat. Bigger is not always better. And the action ALWAYS has to serve the story, not the other way around.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: After the first 30 minutes that promised an intellectual action thriller, the film starts its nosedive into mediocrity by introducing a thief who constantly indulges in disloyalty, for petty gains, towards the IMF and Hunt, but is held in high regards by Hunt. For the life of me, I couldn't understand why. The film also doesn't bother with it.Neither is it concerned with the so called action set pieces. _Fallout_ had plethora of those, one after the other, tied together by a cogent story line. For all its hype, it has 2-3 in a run time of close to 160 minutes, which tested my patience.Reading it's critics' reviews post viewing make me feel as if they have been written by the Entity, the AI behemoth at the center of this. The perceived entertainment value implied by them is not even remotely connected with the reality.It is no wonder that it is faltering at the US box office. It is no Top Gun- Maverick. Crowds are going to turn up, especially outside the US, because of Cruise's star power. But I don't believe this will please most of them.Disappointing.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: An absolute masterclass in producing an enjoyable action movie. Cinematography was great, the story was paced extremely well, and the casting of ALL roles was absolutely perfect.Cruise, Pegg and Rhames were awesome as always, Whigham and Davis were great additions, but the power quartet of Ferguson, Atwell, Klementieff and Kirby, really went above and beyond in making this movie perfect. Not to mention the chilling confidence of Morales as Gabriel, who practically oozes tangible danger.From the pre-opening credits scene to the final act, if you're like me, you will be on the edge of your seat - especially during any fight scene that involves Ferguson or Klementieff - and whilst there are moments that the tempo slows down to advance the story, it is always completely captivating.The single, solitary, disappointment comes as the credits roll, and you remember you're going to have to wait until next year to see how it ends.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Absolutely superb! Was hoping they could do the impossible and surpass Fallout! And Cruise, McQuarrie and co have accomplished this in spades, delivering the best spy/ action thriller in years.It is a next level masterclass of a film, with everything you would expect from an Mission Impossible film and more.The cast are great, with the new additions adding so much to the usual MI crew. The stunts are performed to the usual high standard and give you that Wow feeling you want, The story is fantastic, leaving you wanting more, setting up Part Two really wellGo see this on the best screen possible.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: It should be impossible to fumble the bag so badly on a nostalgia trip movie like this. Just let Tom Cruise run, do some crazy stunts and play the iconic theme music. But no they gotta drag on for three hours with a meaningless storyline just for it to be one part of an incomplete movie. Like whatever happened to movie editing? There's no reason for this movie to be this long and a lot of the content is completely unnecessary to move the plot forward. I don't expect MI movies to have watertight logic but then atleast the writers shouldn't twist themselves into knots thinking they're making a deeper movie than they are, the sooner these movie trends with AI, quantum space tunneling, multiverse nonsense end the better it is for good storylines.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: This latest Mission: Impossible movie is a slam dunk that needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible. Tom Cruise certainly knows how to make a movie. In another universe Cruse could have been Iron Man and I always felt that his aggression with the Mission: Impossible franchise was his way of making up for that. That's probably why the dialog in this movie felt like Ethan Hawk was captain America or something and they are going up against a Bonafede supervillain in the form of an A. I system. As far as I'm concern the best villain of the franchise snice the late and great Phillip Seymour Huffman.The Avengers Assemble as franchise regulars Simon Pegg as Dunn and Ving Rhimes, who I say with glee, started this franchise with Cruse as Luther, make their return as IMF agents. Rebecca Ferguson reprises her role from the last movie and Haley Atwell is in the movie as well, but none of this makes me as happy as Ving still being in the franchise.The action sequences are so good in this picture. It was worth having to stay in me seat for almost three hours just so they can add a little more action in-between the Hero's journey dialogue.And this is just part one!? Part two has some big shoes to fill!\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: I love Tom Cruise movies, but this one feels pretty contrived. Beyond the plot, Grace was the biggest detriment to the movie. The character started out amusing but her shtick became insufferable and Ethan's infatuation idiotic. How they handled Ilsa feels both rushed and cheap, with no emotional weight felt. The biggest stunt was spoiled beforehand which I suppose did its job in getting me in the seat, but totally ruins the moment in film. The final act also lacked any tension and was honestly a little boring - there wasn't any real cleverness.Still, it was humorous throughout, had a good amount of charm and the production value is evident. That's enough for me to be above average but it's unlikely I'll watch the followup in theater.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: As a hardout Mission fan. I can confirm 5 years was definitely worth the wait. The film is extremally charming and filled with exciting humor, action and story-telling. Tom and Hayley really bring the film so much joy and create wonderful chemistry. The chase scene in Rome puts you on the edge of your seat and nothing prepares you for the daring things Tom and Hayley pull off in the train sequence.. Tom really understands the action genre and did not disappoint with this film. There is a perfect blend between foundation building for the story and the action sequences. The film is a beautiful set up to the part 2 coming next year.. Brilliant Watch 100/10.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Straight up Dead Reckoning Part 1 was fine. I think it's the weakest out of the last four instalments.I can't put my finger on one exact thing but it just felt a little underdone compared to the last few M:I and was expecting big things the whole movie. It was a combination of things like the acting felt a little weak I guess, the script was just fine, the action was decent but not great compared to other M:I and to the likes of John Wick that I'm now used to. The plot with the A. I is nothing new but it's always still interesting and especially at a time in the real world where the advancements seem to be heating up but the whole pickpocketing the key for 2 hours also got boring so fast. Too many cliches started piling up. The hand to hand combat was some of the weakest stuff I've seen it a while especially the Venice bridge scene, it looked awful, like I could see the choreography. The best scene for me was the desert storm at the start which really had my attention but everything after that seemed just average.I don't know if everyone else is now completely over their only trick being having someone go as someone else with these masks. It's so boring to me now and at a stage I'm kinda rolling my eyes. I really hope the machine blowing a fuse means we have seen the last of them.Tom Cruise is awesome with the stunts he does and will always have respect for the things him doing them but I really wish they didn't show the motorbike cliff jump scene in the trailer. What you see in the trailer is literally the whole stunt, don't get me wrong it's truly impressive but they showed the whole thing and just completely killed it for me.I'm slightly bummed with this one and just coming off seeing Indian Jones and having a lot more fun watching that. I don't care about runtimes but you have to have me sucked in and the whole time, I felt the time...People will love this movie but M:I may have fizzled out with me a bit after this one.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Greetings again from the darkness. The challenge in continuing the \"Mission: Impossible\" franchise is that fans expect each entry to be \"bigger\" and more awe-inspiring than the last. With the seventh film in the series, and the third straight he has directed, writer-director Christopher McQuarrie and superstar actor and daredevil Tom Cruise have managed to accomplish what seemed unlikely ... they have delivered Ethan Hunt's biggest and grandest mission yet. Prepare to be awed by the action.You should know that this is \"Part One\" and it runs 163 minutes, a full hour longer than most movies, and exponentially more expensive to produce. All this during an age when ultra-high-budget blockbusters are being rumored to be fading from public interest. Of course, we are only one year removed from Tom Cruise's TOP GUN: MAVERICK being credited with 'saving cinema', so stay on alert for a 'sky is falling' panic. McQuarrie co-wrote the script with Erik Jendresen (\"Band of Brothers\"), and they remain faithful to the characters and storylines established by the TV series creator, Bruce Geller.There may never have been an actor more suited to a recurring role than Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt (Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones might be the closest). The story itself is fairly straightforward, even if the item being chased often feels like a MacGuffin. Your questioning of how a 'simple' spy-thriller can be effective is understandable, yet it's fascinating to watch as Ethan Hunt's mission in life as an agent is evaluated, as is the cost he's paid as a man. Providing a contemporary theme, the obscure object of desire is an all-powerful key (actually two parts of a key) based on controlling an all-encompassing Artificial Intelligence (AI).In a twist on a familiar theme (and a classic comedy film), we have Airports, Trains, and EVs, the latter being a tiny Fiat with handcuffs. Still, the car chase is everything we might hope, while the high-tech facial search in the airport sequence delivers the thrills for techie viewers, and the train sparring occurs inside as well as on top. And lest you be worried, there are enough Cruise sprint scenes here to put CHARIOTS OF FIRE to shame.Familiar faces include Ethan Hunt's team of Luther (Ving Rhames, who along with Cruise, has appeared in all 7 MI films), Benji (Simon Pegg), and Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). It's nice to again see (and hear) Henry Czerny as Kittridge, Vanessa Kirby as arms dealer The White Widow, and Esai Morales - as Gabriel, the required villain in search of the same key as our good guys. New faces include Haylee Atwell as master pickpocket Grace, whose soul may or may not be beyond salvation; Cary Elwes as agency director Denlinger; Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis as officers after rogue Hunt; and Pom Klementieff as a hired assassin.The stunt work here is outstanding, and of course, Tom Cruise is renowned for personally handling many of the most breathtaking acts - the most memorable one here being his riding of a motorcycle off a cliff. This stunt has a 'making of' video that's been available for a while. As movie goers, we've never seen anything like it. This part one was originally scheduled for release in 2021 (thanks a lot, COVID), and now Part Two is set for 2024. It's been 27 years since the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE (1996) with Jon Voight ... Cruise was 34 in that one. This particular mission is the biggest yet, and it would certainly be impossible for the rest of us. It's a mission that will be closed out in Part Two, and simultaneously bring an end to Cruise's remarkable run as Ethan Hunt.Opening July 12, 2023.\n",

It was as if the writers of this movie just gave up on their jobs when they wrote this. Easily the weakest MI movie ever filmed. It had me staring at my watch every 20 minutes. As others have mentioned, the character development in this movie is also truly awful. I have barely any interest in seeing Part Two of Dead Reckoning at this point. The high scores this movie is getting absolutely baffle me. This movie by no means deserves a score higher than a 6 or a 6.5.\n",

The music attempts to turn even the most minor scene into some sort of heart-pounding climax.There are endless ridiculous fights in which Tom Cruise is predictably unstoppable, no matter how many opponents he's up against. Slim girls get to beat up multiple men. (Emily Blunt was right when, commenting on a fight in \"Sicario\" in which, refreshingly, she loses to a bigger guy, she noted that Hollywood fight scenes in which 110-pound women whip larger males are \"so cheesy.\")The dull, tepid, way-too-pretty villain is, implausibly, a formidable fighter but sure doesn't look like one. An action movie is only as good as its villain is evil; this guy looks like a French fashion mogul.He and Cruise fight on top of -- wait for it -- a moving train! Haven't we seen that ridiculous sort of thing a hundred times before?The tediously overcomplicated plot makes it hard to keep track of who's on which side, nor do we care. Apparently, as is usual these days, we're supposed to root against the U. S. government.In all scenes involving conversations, virtually EVERY line is merely plot exposition in which characters tell us, in stilted dialogue, what's going on, what's supposed to happen, and how we're supposed to feel.The much-touted parachute jump is actually disappointing. It's over quite fast, and its main source of interest is that, if you've seen the promotional video, you know that Cruise himself actually made that jump.The only truly enjoyable sequence -- the cleverly worked-out rescue attempts on the falling train -- comes at the end, after nearly two and a half hours of empty cartoonish nonsense...Including, of course, an overlong cartoonish car chase, obligatory in dumb summer movies.\n",

This time, there's some Skynet-like sentient-AI that's manipulating nefarious types to take over the world, so the IMF team are out to get the two halves of key that can stop it.Isla (Ferguson), Benji (Pegg) and Luther (Rhames) are back, as well as CIA boss Kittridge (Czerny), with Grace (Atwell), a thief, being the newcomer. The bad guys that keep thwarting them are Gabriel (Morales) from Ethan's past, and Paris (Klementieff). The consistency of having McQuarrie as director of the two previous films helps, with everything feeling assured and this working as a really solid follow-up to 'Fallout'.There's some funny moments, some sincere ones, and some of Ethan running, as contractually-obliged. The whole final scene on the train is excellent, with so many things happening, but there's plenty of good set-pieces throughout, including a good car chase. However, the piece-de-resistance is the motorbike off the cliff into a BASE jump is something else. The fact Cruise did it for real, multiple times, is crazy and inspiring.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Man.... I wish I loved this movie more than I did. Don't get me wrong, it's a solid action movie with jaw-dropping stunts (some of the best in the series), but as a Mission: Impossible movie, it felt like a small step backward for the franchise. Fallout had mind-blowing action sequences and stunt work, along with developing Ethan's relationship with Ilsa, providing closure with Julia, showing the lengths Ethan would go to protect those closest to him, and battling an imposing villain. Dead Reckoning: Part One stretches the movie across two films only to seemingly showcase action spectacle after action spectacle while sacrificing character development. Characters I have grown to love over a decade of films felt sidelined, ignored, or wasted. Hayley Atwell's new character chewed up most of the screen time, and while she was fantastic, I wanted to see more of the original team. The new villain had an inconsistent ability that confused more than intimidated. There were some important emotional moments that I just didn't feel the weight of when I definitely should have. Part Two might tie everything together and make me enjoy Part One more in retrospect, but unfortunately, I left wanting more from this one.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Just got out of seeing this movie. I am really disappointed that they totally killed off the potential relationship between Ethan and Ilsa. I am totally OK with her dying but the way that they did it and how anti-climactic it was after building up her character so much in the previous two films. Just seems like she would've deserved a better death than that. Also, what was the point of showing the two characters getting closer to each other, and in the last film, his ex-wife, basically giving them permission to move forward when you're just going to kill her off like that. Honestly, Rebecca Ferguson revised this franchise two movies ago and I think killing off her character was a big mistake. Even in the scenes that she's in it doesn't even seem like she's playing the same person. I wonder if they wrote her out of the movie because she's too busy with the rest of her work. Hayley Atwell's character doesn't make sense to me either. Just put her in the IMF because she can pick some pockets? This all seems forced. Maybe most won't agree, but I think this development totally ruined the movie for me.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Just saw this one in a theatre, and boy... what an adrenaline rush it is. The latest Mission Impossible features some of the most incredible stunts ever put to camera. The story is absolutely exhilarating and continues to bring new life to a veteran movie franchise. The sheer scale of this movie is epic, and with every twist and turn of the movie, you cannot help but marvel at the incredible sets used to bring this movie to life. Such a movie begs to be seen on the biggest screen possible where you can truly feel the grandeur of the film. Tom Cruise has once again delivered one of the best movies of the year, and I cannot recommend that you see it enough!\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: To me, a new M:I film is an event. From Part 4 onwards, they've been spectacular (all 10/10's).There's some good stuff here for sure, and overall it's a solid 8, but it's simply not as good as previous entries.I kept noticing that a lot of scenes had just 2 or 3 people in them, and I kept imagining the crew all masked up, as well as the cast when the camera wasn't on them. It can't be easy to make a huge movie like this during a pandemic, but it definitely shows.The A. I. plot is quite good, and Hunt's as-yet-unknown backstory quite intriguing, but the whole story basically revolves around: \"I've got the key, now she's got the key, now he's got the key\" etc. So much pick-pocketing.Also, I really wish they hadn't ruined the motorcycle jump in the promos. If you've seen the promo, you've seen the scene. There are really only 3 or 4 action sequences, and nothing we haven't really seen before. I actually enjoyed the first desert shoot-out the best.And- oh!- the exposition! There's a scene near the beginning that reminded me of a Neil Breen(!) movie, where powerful people sit in a room and just spout buzz words like \"nuclear war,\" \"economic collapse,\" \"dogs and cats living together\" etc.THAT said, it's still an 8/10. Tom always gives it his best, the rest of the cast is good (especially all four female leads) and I thought the added humour with Hunt's character was a nice touch. I'd rather watch this ten times over than any blatant cyncial Disney cash-grab.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Good God. I feel ashamed for approaching this film with a modicum of doubt that Tom would still be able to deliver. Unbelievably, this epic actually manages to top the brilliant Fallout. Tom is literally going to die if he keeps doing these stunts. The motorbike sequence is utterly ludicrous. Intriguing plot with actual stakes and some familiar faces ably supported by brilliant new allies and villains. Sets up Part II perfectly with a sensational finale that homages Back to the Future 3, MI:1 and Speed. It is funny, action packed, polished and exhilarating. Harrison was great last week, but Tom is still the King. 9/10.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: I was lucky to be able to watch this 4 days before its official release in Czech Republic as a pre-premiere (didn't know such a thing existed) and it was the first time I've felt real excitement to go watch a film at the cinema in ages thanks to the recent genius combination of Fallout and Top Gun 2.I know what they were trying to do with this film. Bringing Kittridge back and a convoluted train finale all harked back to the 1st movie that sparked it all off. Explaining that convoluted storyline along the way harks back to the criticisms made about that same first film.The sky jump stunt was an attempt to beat the stunts from Tom Cruise in previous installments that have now become a beloved trademark of the franchise.But this film unfortunately overall is most reminiscent of the second installment which was Tom Cruise centric and lacked any real impossible mission requiring teamwork, real stakes and ingenious problem solving.In fact, it could have even been intentional that this film reminds the viewer of Mission Impossible 2. The photos in the film of past Ethan Hunt when searching for present Ethan Hunt show him with his longer hair as he looked in that second film.Ultimately, I expected the story to be way better than what we get in this instalment.There are 2 guys that keep appearing at each scene trying to catch Ethan which seems a very cheap simple story.And the very simple plot is explained in long scenes to make it seem way more complicated that it actually is (people complained there should be more explanation in the first film, but at least the plot in the first film actually required brain power), and I have to say that some of the acting is quite poor at times, not helped by some rather cheesy lines in the script, including the lines and accents in the opening Russian submarine sequence.There is also not that much action. 3 main action sequences for a close to 3 hour movie, which are the desert shoot out at the beginning, the Venice car chase, and the train crash at the end.I thought the alleyway fight scene, which some have praised, was really quite subpar and not very enthralling.The best action scene is the Venice car chase because it is genuinely funny (yes, because it is excellently laugh out loud funny, but not in any way tense); I never had the feeling that I was on the edge of my seat.The motorcycle sky jump scene was a major disappointment after the hype because if you didn't know Cruise actually did do that stunt, they used so much CGI that people would just assume it was computer generated. It actually reminded me of Pierce Brosnan's riding the tsunami in Die Another Day (sorry Tom! The stunt is still awesome!).The same for the train at the end. I know they actually made that train, and probably actually threw it off a bridge, but it doesn't look real. Though it is a long action finale and very fun to watch, for me the lack of realism takes away any tension. You are enjoying it for its visual value, but again not feeling any 'wow' factor or tension.At the end of Fallout, for example, you really felt Ethan Hunt was battered, bruised, worn out and still fighting to save humanity. There is none of that.The most tragic thing about this movie is that, unlike in the best of the previous films, we're back to the team being irrelevant in this one. Benji and Luther don't actually do very much.And poor Ilsa. Fallout ended with Ethan's ex-wife essentially giving him permission to move on and be with Ilsa.The relationship between Ilsa and Hunt had been built up over two excellent movies - Rogue Nation and Fallout - and in this film she says almost nothing, looks grumpy and sad all the time, and dies in an anticlimactic fight that is literally spelt out to the audience as a way to replace her with newcomer Grace.Grace, played by Hayley Atwell, is good. A likeable character and a capable actress, but I don't get the story unless Rebecca Ferguson said she wants out the franchise.The film is all about chasing \"the key.\" No twists. No high stakes. There is virtually no grittiness in this outing. It feels very light.Ultimately I was hoping to enjoy a quality film in the franchise. A movie like Oblivion, Edge of Tomorrow, Fallout, Top Gun 2 or American Made that you can show to anyone and say these are recent really high quality films starring this guy called Tom Cruise.This is not one of those films.It is more like The Mummy. It is better than Mission Impossible 2 but not better than any of the others in the franchise.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One confirms that Mission Impossible is the best franchise currently going and possibly ever made. A 2 hour 43 minute adrenaline rush that contains some of the best action sequences put to film, embarrasses the majority of the competition out there and sets the stage for a magnificent part 2 whilst still being a satisfying adventure in its own right.This is possibly the most open and obvious a Mission film has been with its deeper meaning for cinema and what aspect of Cruise's career is being dissected this time with a film that focuses on Ethan's relationship with women and basically outright declares AI to be a soulless monster and how the human element is always needed (perfect film to release during a writer's strike).Tom Cruise is perfect as Ethan Hunt and the strongest aspect this time round is when the film explores what made Ethan who he is and reminds you he genuinely cares about his team but that comes at a cost. Physically, the madman is still going strong with his stunts, driving a bike off a cliff in truly breathtaking fashion.Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg and Rebecca Ferguson remain the best IMF team and all play to their strengths here. The longer this series goes on the more authentic their growing friendship feels. Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis get more than expected and their buddy cop antics are a lot of fun.With Esai Morales' charismatic yet terrifying Gabriel and Pom Klementieff's terrific henchman of few words, this franchise finally has more good villains than bad. The return of Henry Czerny as Kittridge is glorious and he remains as gleefully despicable as his first appearance.The best new addition is easily Hayley Atwell. She plays a type of character never seen before in these films which makes her character and dynamic with Cruise fresh in comparison to everyone who's come before and their chemistry is magnetic. Instantaneous from the second they interact.Christopher McQuarrie's direction is phenomenal. The action sequences are suitably practical (this is how you spend $290 million), and the camera gets as close to the action as humanly possible, he remains one of the best in the business working at this scale. There's plenty of canted angles as a nice homage to De Palma's original and it helps give this one its own style in comparison to McQuarrie's previous entries.The pacing is really impressive with the film feeling like it's in a perpetual third act from its first airport heist (which is so much fun). Lorne Balfe does the music once again and yet again it's a highlight of the film, he knows how to elevate everything so well and really hammers home the emotional beats.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Ethan Hunt has left the mere secret agent status and has ascended to the all living perfect messiah.There is so much wrong with this movie, which seriously pains me because I seriously love this series. The mission impossible movies have steadily become more convoluted and more stupidly written. This film reaches the peak of absurdity, feeling more like an over the top fast and furious movie. All foolish action, cheap parlor tricks to pull the heart strings (empty relationships), horrible writing, poor plot development.I mean seriously what ever happened to show don't tell?! This is becoming rather ridiculous.*convoluted villain dialogue*\n",
            "\"So what you're telling me is you plan to establish a new world order if you get that key and if someone stops you that would be bad?!\"Has Ethan Hunt suddenly become this vanilla James Bond? With the Bond girl cycling through every few films? Lazy writing. Not natural feeling. Forced. BlighIt pains me to give this so low.The truth is, this movie is mindless entertaining action. Tom Cruise delivers on some awesome stunts (seldom compared to other MI films). It's not horrible. It's fun entertainment, but a scour on the (in my opinion) reputable authentic feeling mission impossible series.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: So you probably watched IM 6 and said, they can't make it any better can they? Or Top Gun 2, guess again, this is an adrenaline action movie with a good story, well written, action scenes that just blow you away, not a boring moment and you are on the edge of your seat all the time, this is how you make movies! Tom Cruise did it again, WOW!! It's an exhausting ride he takes you on, man I forgot to eat my popcorn and by the time i finally wanted some my wife had eaten all of it, but hey I was so immersed into the movie that time stood still and i forgot everything around me.Go and see it, this one gets my full recommendation, the only reason it's not a 10 is due to the fact it's not a completely new type of movie, however this one is done as a good action movie should be made, i don't see how they could have made it better, I really can't, go watch it and have a good time while you do it, it will put a big smile on your face that's for sure.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Am huge fan of MI franchise. The best part about all MI movies were how they plan and pull off an impossible mission. Thus I am quite disappointed on how this mission never seemed too difficult , let alone impossible.Action was okay. Car chase was funny, but not exciting. Jumping off the cliff seemed forced to me. Why would you keep driving uphill when you can take short cuts to reach the train. It wasn't even a fast train. The key kept being stolen from pockets too many times which makes you wonder how lazy the scripting was. Kill old gf to make new gf was also lazy writing.Unlike other MIs, Ethan had no single smart move or plan. It felt more like let's go and see what happens.Am not sure how MI fans ignored all these weaknesses and gave this film 8+ rating.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: This was a great movie. However, it lost a star from me for making the audience believe Ilsa is dead. They've spent two films building up Ilsa as being Ethan's equal, and hinted at an eventual romance. She's been able to fight off multiple men bare-handed yet she meets her demise by one guy when she has a sword? Then they brush past her death like it means nothing, only for her to be replaced by a new woman. I thought it was a huge disservice to the character.I know Rebecca Ferguson is very busy so she might have asked to leave, but I'm hoping this isn't the end for my favorite character in these films. She deserves a happy ending, or at least a better death than the one she received in this movie. It really took me out of the rest of the film. Hopefully, we'll see her again in Part Two.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Remember that classic MI scene where they broke in at CIA, and Cruise was hanging from the ceiling using wires? It's not a huge setpiece, but that scene is a nailbiting example of ingenious problem solving.In 'Dead Reckoning' there's none of that. Here it's keys changing hands every 10 minutes that is suppose to pass as suspense. And of course the only true selling point: the stunts performed by Tom Cruise.But I want and expect more than that.A large part of the film is devoted to people sitting or standing in a room, explaining what the plot is. Endless talking and explaining. We are told in several scenes the same information we just heard. Worst one is Benji, who is merely there to repeat things for someone in the cast, to make sure everyone in the audience knows what is going on. That is sloppy writing. One of the biggest no-no's as a screenwriter is resolving to \"so what you are saying is, that...\" info sharing. Benji does this all the time. And he is as incompetent as usual. And he is supposed to be a part of a small and unique team that is saving the world? Really?I hope MI:8 isn't just another Tom Cruise stunt reel where it looks like they make the story up as the go along, as long as all marks are checked in the end (running, face swapping, dealing with heights etc), and where character development takes a backseat. Bigger is not always better. And the action ALWAYS has to serve the story, not the other way around.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: After the first 30 minutes that promised an intellectual action thriller, the film starts its nosedive into mediocrity by introducing a thief who constantly indulges in disloyalty, for petty gains, towards the IMF and Hunt, but is held in high regards by Hunt. For the life of me, I couldn't understand why. The film also doesn't bother with it.Neither is it concerned with the so called action set pieces. _Fallout_ had plethora of those, one after the other, tied together by a cogent story line. For all its hype, it has 2-3 in a run time of close to 160 minutes, which tested my patience.Reading it's critics' reviews post viewing make me feel as if they have been written by the Entity, the AI behemoth at the center of this. The perceived entertainment value implied by them is not even remotely connected with the reality.It is no wonder that it is faltering at the US box office. It is no Top Gun- Maverick. Crowds are going to turn up, especially outside the US, because of Cruise's star power. But I don't believe this will please most of them.Disappointing.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: An absolute masterclass in producing an enjoyable action movie. Cinematography was great, the story was paced extremely well, and the casting of ALL roles was absolutely perfect.Cruise, Pegg and Rhames were awesome as always, Whigham and Davis were great additions, but the power quartet of Ferguson, Atwell, Klementieff and Kirby, really went above and beyond in making this movie perfect. Not to mention the chilling confidence of Morales as Gabriel, who practically oozes tangible danger.From the pre-opening credits scene to the final act, if you're like me, you will be on the edge of your seat - especially during any fight scene that involves Ferguson or Klementieff - and whilst there are moments that the tempo slows down to advance the story, it is always completely captivating.The single, solitary, disappointment comes as the credits roll, and you remember you're going to have to wait until next year to see how it ends.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Absolutely superb! Was hoping they could do the impossible and surpass Fallout! And Cruise, McQuarrie and co have accomplished this in spades, delivering the best spy/ action thriller in years.It is a next level masterclass of a film, with everything you would expect from an Mission Impossible film and more.The cast are great, with the new additions adding so much to the usual MI crew. The stunts are performed to the usual high standard and give you that Wow feeling you want, The story is fantastic, leaving you wanting more, setting up Part Two really wellGo see this on the best screen possible.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: It should be impossible to fumble the bag so badly on a nostalgia trip movie like this. Just let Tom Cruise run, do some crazy stunts and play the iconic theme music. But no they gotta drag on for three hours with a meaningless storyline just for it to be one part of an incomplete movie. Like whatever happened to movie editing? There's no reason for this movie to be this long and a lot of the content is completely unnecessary to move the plot forward. I don't expect MI movies to have watertight logic but then atleast the writers shouldn't twist themselves into knots thinking they're making a deeper movie than they are, the sooner these movie trends with AI, quantum space tunneling, multiverse nonsense end the better it is for good storylines.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: This latest Mission: Impossible movie is a slam dunk that needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible. Tom Cruise certainly knows how to make a movie. In another universe Cruse could have been Iron Man and I always felt that his aggression with the Mission: Impossible franchise was his way of making up for that. That's probably why the dialog in this movie felt like Ethan Hawk was captain America or something and they are going up against a Bonafede supervillain in the form of an A. I system. As far as I'm concern the best villain of the franchise snice the late and great Phillip Seymour Huffman.The Avengers Assemble as franchise regulars Simon Pegg as Dunn and Ving Rhimes, who I say with glee, started this franchise with Cruse as Luther, make their return as IMF agents. Rebecca Ferguson reprises her role from the last movie and Haley Atwell is in the movie as well, but none of this makes me as happy as Ving still being in the franchise.The action sequences are so good in this picture. It was worth having to stay in me seat for almost three hours just so they can add a little more action in-between the Hero's journey dialogue.And this is just part one!? Part two has some big shoes to fill!\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: I love Tom Cruise movies, but this one feels pretty contrived. Beyond the plot, Grace was the biggest detriment to the movie. The character started out amusing but her shtick became insufferable and Ethan's infatuation idiotic. How they handled Ilsa feels both rushed and cheap, with no emotional weight felt. The biggest stunt was spoiled beforehand which I suppose did its job in getting me in the seat, but totally ruins the moment in film. The final act also lacked any tension and was honestly a little boring - there wasn't any real cleverness.Still, it was humorous throughout, had a good amount of charm and the production value is evident. That's enough for me to be above average but it's unlikely I'll watch the followup in theater.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: As a hardout Mission fan. I can confirm 5 years was definitely worth the wait. The film is extremally charming and filled with exciting humor, action and story-telling. Tom and Hayley really bring the film so much joy and create wonderful chemistry. The chase scene in Rome puts you on the edge of your seat and nothing prepares you for the daring things Tom and Hayley pull off in the train sequence.. Tom really understands the action genre and did not disappoint with this film. There is a perfect blend between foundation building for the story and the action sequences. The film is a beautiful set up to the part 2 coming next year.. Brilliant Watch 100/10.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Straight up Dead Reckoning Part 1 was fine. I think it's the weakest out of the last four instalments.I can't put my finger on one exact thing but it just felt a little underdone compared to the last few M:I and was expecting big things the whole movie. It was a combination of things like the acting felt a little weak I guess, the script was just fine, the action was decent but not great compared to other M:I and to the likes of John Wick that I'm now used to. The plot with the A. I is nothing new but it's always still interesting and especially at a time in the real world where the advancements seem to be heating up but the whole pickpocketing the key for 2 hours also got boring so fast. Too many cliches started piling up. The hand to hand combat was some of the weakest stuff I've seen it a while especially the Venice bridge scene, it looked awful, like I could see the choreography. The best scene for me was the desert storm at the start which really had my attention but everything after that seemed just average.I don't know if everyone else is now completely over their only trick being having someone go as someone else with these masks. It's so boring to me now and at a stage I'm kinda rolling my eyes. I really hope the machine blowing a fuse means we have seen the last of them.Tom Cruise is awesome with the stunts he does and will always have respect for the things him doing them but I really wish they didn't show the motorbike cliff jump scene in the trailer. What you see in the trailer is literally the whole stunt, don't get me wrong it's truly impressive but they showed the whole thing and just completely killed it for me.I'm slightly bummed with this one and just coming off seeing Indian Jones and having a lot more fun watching that. I don't care about runtimes but you have to have me sucked in and the whole time, I felt the time...People will love this movie but M:I may have fizzled out with me a bit after this one.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Greetings again from the darkness. The challenge in continuing the \"Mission: Impossible\" franchise is that fans expect each entry to be \"bigger\" and more awe-inspiring than the last. With the seventh film in the series, and the third straight he has directed, writer-director Christopher McQuarrie and superstar actor and daredevil Tom Cruise have managed to accomplish what seemed unlikely ... they have delivered Ethan Hunt's biggest and grandest mission yet. Prepare to be awed by the action.You should know that this is \"Part One\" and it runs 163 minutes, a full hour longer than most movies, and exponentially more expensive to produce. All this during an age when ultra-high-budget blockbusters are being rumored to be fading from public interest. Of course, we are only one year removed from Tom Cruise's TOP GUN: MAVERICK being credited with 'saving cinema', so stay on alert for a 'sky is falling' panic. McQuarrie co-wrote the script with Erik Jendresen (\"Band of Brothers\"), and they remain faithful to the characters and storylines established by the TV series creator, Bruce Geller.There may never have been an actor more suited to a recurring role than Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt (Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones might be the closest). The story itself is fairly straightforward, even if the item being chased often feels like a MacGuffin. Your questioning of how a 'simple' spy-thriller can be effective is understandable, yet it's fascinating to watch as Ethan Hunt's mission in life as an agent is evaluated, as is the cost he's paid as a man. Providing a contemporary theme, the obscure object of desire is an all-powerful key (actually two parts of a key) based on controlling an all-encompassing Artificial Intelligence (AI).In a twist on a familiar theme (and a classic comedy film), we have Airports, Trains, and EVs, the latter being a tiny Fiat with handcuffs. Still, the car chase is everything we might hope, while the high-tech facial search in the airport sequence delivers the thrills for techie viewers, and the train sparring occurs inside as well as on top. And lest you be worried, there are enough Cruise sprint scenes here to put CHARIOTS OF FIRE to shame.Familiar faces include Ethan Hunt's team of Luther (Ving Rhames, who along with Cruise, has appeared in all 7 MI films), Benji (Simon Pegg), and Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). It's nice to again see (and hear) Henry Czerny as Kittridge, Vanessa Kirby as arms dealer The White Widow, and Esai Morales - as Gabriel, the required villain in search of the same key as our good guys. New faces include Haylee Atwell as master pickpocket Grace, whose soul may or may not be beyond salvation; Cary Elwes as agency director Denlinger; Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis as officers after rogue Hunt; and Pom Klementieff as a hired assassin.The stunt work here is outstanding, and of course, Tom Cruise is renowned for personally handling many of the most breathtaking acts - the most memorable one here being his riding of a motorcycle off a cliff. This stunt has a 'making of' video that's been available for a while. As movie goers, we've never seen anything like it. This part one was originally scheduled for release in 2021 (thanks a lot, COVID), and now Part Two is set for 2024. It's been 27 years since the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE (1996) with Jon Voight ... Cruise was 34 in that one. This particular mission is the biggest yet, and it would certainly be impossible for the rest of us. It's a mission that will be closed out in Part Two, and simultaneously bring an end to Cruise's remarkable run as Ethan Hunt.Opening July 12, 2023.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: This movie started out promising but by the end, it just felt like being robbed of two and a half hours. I am a big fan of the MI movies (including MI2, which people seem to hate) and I could appreciate this movie for the few scenes that it did right, but it treats the audience like idiots in its bland, repetitive storyline (how many times do we need to hear the words \"the key\" and \"the entity\"? It was as if the writers of this movie just gave up on their jobs when they wrote this. Easily the weakest MI movie ever filmed. It had me staring at my watch every 20 minutes. As others have mentioned, the character development in this movie is also truly awful. I have barely any interest in seeing Part Two of Dead Reckoning at this point. The high scores this movie is getting absolutely baffle me. This movie by no means deserves a score higher than a 6 or a 6.5.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Basically, this movie is big, loud, and stupid.Definitely TOO loud, in fact. The music attempts to turn even the most minor scene into some sort of heart-pounding climax.There are endless ridiculous fights in which Tom Cruise is predictably unstoppable, no matter how many opponents he's up against. Slim girls get to beat up multiple men. (Emily Blunt was right when, commenting on a fight in \"Sicario\" in which, refreshingly, she loses to a bigger guy, she noted that Hollywood fight scenes in which 110-pound women whip larger males are \"so cheesy.\")The dull, tepid, way-too-pretty villain is, implausibly, a formidable fighter but sure doesn't look like one. An action movie is only as good as its villain is evil; this guy looks like a French fashion mogul.He and Cruise fight on top of -- wait for it -- a moving train! Haven't we seen that ridiculous sort of thing a hundred times before?The tediously overcomplicated plot makes it hard to keep track of who's on which side, nor do we care. Apparently, as is usual these days, we're supposed to root against the U. S. government.In all scenes involving conversations, virtually EVERY line is merely plot exposition in which characters tell us, in stilted dialogue, what's going on, what's supposed to happen, and how we're supposed to feel.The much-touted parachute jump is actually disappointing. It's over quite fast, and its main source of interest is that, if you've seen the promotional video, you know that Cruise himself actually made that jump.The only truly enjoyable sequence -- the cleverly worked-out rescue attempts on the falling train -- comes at the end, after nearly two and a half hours of empty cartoonish nonsense...Including, of course, an overlong cartoonish car chase, obligatory in dumb summer movies.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: The latest Mission: Impossible film is a part one of two story but finishes in a satisfying way rather than annoying and you won't feel hard done by.It's another great big screen action film that we've come to expect. It feels huge the whole time however I must say I while the set pieces were stellar, the hand to hand combat scenes were not great and a big step down from the last film (Fallout).Thebeginning is slow with a lot of expository being dumped (more than you'd usually see) but once it gets going it is pretty nonstop.This is a good chapter and Haley Atwell shines but it is nowhere near my favorite of the series.7/10Mi rankingsMi6 Fallout\n",

            "Skipping non-numeric rating: 'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part I (M:I7) is another strong entry in the action/spy series, with Ethan (Cruise) looking slightly older, but not less determined to save the world. I believe the sequel to this film will be his last outing - but we'll see. This time, there's some Skynet-like sentient-AI that's manipulating nefarious types to take over the world, so the IMF team are out to get the two halves of key that can stop it.Isla (Ferguson), Benji (Pegg) and Luther (Rhames) are back, as well as CIA boss Kittridge (Czerny), with Grace (Atwell), a thief, being the newcomer. The bad guys that keep thwarting them are Gabriel (Morales) from Ethan's past, and Paris (Klementieff). The consistency of having McQuarrie as director of the two previous films helps, with everything feeling assured and this working as a really solid follow-up to 'Fallout'.There's some funny moments, some sincere ones, and some of Ethan running, as contractually-obliged. The whole final scene on the train is excellent, with so many things happening, but there's plenty of good set-pieces throughout, including a good car chase. However, the piece-de-resistance is the motorbike off the cliff into a BASE jump is something else. The fact Cruise did it for real, multiple times, is crazy and inspiring.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Man.... I wish I loved this movie more than I did. Don't get me wrong, it's a solid action movie with jaw-dropping stunts (some of the best in the series), but as a Mission: Impossible movie, it felt like a small step backward for the franchise. Fallout had mind-blowing action sequences and stunt work, along with developing Ethan's relationship with Ilsa, providing closure with Julia, showing the lengths Ethan would go to protect those closest to him, and battling an imposing villain. Dead Reckoning: Part One stretches the movie across two films only to seemingly showcase action spectacle after action spectacle while sacrificing character development. Characters I have grown to love over a decade of films felt sidelined, ignored, or wasted. Hayley Atwell's new character chewed up most of the screen time, and while she was fantastic, I wanted to see more of the original team. The new villain had an inconsistent ability that confused more than intimidated. There were some important emotional moments that I just didn't feel the weight of when I definitely should have. Part Two might tie everything together and make me enjoy Part One more in retrospect, but unfortunately, I left wanting more from this one.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Just got out of seeing this movie. I am really disappointed that they totally killed off the potential relationship between Ethan and Ilsa. I am totally OK with her dying but the way that they did it and how anti-climactic it was after building up her character so much in the previous two films. Just seems like she would've deserved a better death than that. Also, what was the point of showing the two characters getting closer to each other, and in the last film, his ex-wife, basically giving them permission to move forward when you're just going to kill her off like that. Honestly, Rebecca Ferguson revised this franchise two movies ago and I think killing off her character was a big mistake. Even in the scenes that she's in it doesn't even seem like she's playing the same person. I wonder if they wrote her out of the movie because she's too busy with the rest of her work. Hayley Atwell's character doesn't make sense to me either. Just put her in the IMF because she can pick some pockets? This all seems forced. Maybe most won't agree, but I think this development totally ruined the movie for me.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Just saw this one in a theatre, and boy... what an adrenaline rush it is. The latest Mission Impossible features some of the most incredible stunts ever put to camera. The story is absolutely exhilarating and continues to bring new life to a veteran movie franchise. The sheer scale of this movie is epic, and with every twist and turn of the movie, you cannot help but marvel at the incredible sets used to bring this movie to life. Such a movie begs to be seen on the biggest screen possible where you can truly feel the grandeur of the film. Tom Cruise has once again delivered one of the best movies of the year, and I cannot recommend that you see it enough!\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: To me, a new M:I film is an event. From Part 4 onwards, they've been spectacular (all 10/10's).There's some good stuff here for sure, and overall it's a solid 8, but it's simply not as good as previous entries.I kept noticing that a lot of scenes had just 2 or 3 people in them, and I kept imagining the crew all masked up, as well as the cast when the camera wasn't on them. It can't be easy to make a huge movie like this during a pandemic, but it definitely shows.The A. I. plot is quite good, and Hunt's as-yet-unknown backstory quite intriguing, but the whole story basically revolves around: \"I've got the key, now she's got the key, now he's got the key\" etc. So much pick-pocketing.Also, I really wish they hadn't ruined the motorcycle jump in the promos. If you've seen the promo, you've seen the scene. There are really only 3 or 4 action sequences, and nothing we haven't really seen before. I actually enjoyed the first desert shoot-out the best.And- oh!- the exposition! There's a scene near the beginning that reminded me of a Neil Breen(!) movie, where powerful people sit in a room and just spout buzz words like \"nuclear war,\" \"economic collapse,\" \"dogs and cats living together\" etc.THAT said, it's still an 8/10. Tom always gives it his best, the rest of the cast is good (especially all four female leads) and I thought the added humour with Hunt's character was a nice touch. I'd rather watch this ten times over than any blatant cyncial Disney cash-grab.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Good God. I feel ashamed for approaching this film with a modicum of doubt that Tom would still be able to deliver. Unbelievably, this epic actually manages to top the brilliant Fallout. Tom is literally going to die if he keeps doing these stunts. The motorbike sequence is utterly ludicrous. Intriguing plot with actual stakes and some familiar faces ably supported by brilliant new allies and villains. Sets up Part II perfectly with a sensational finale that homages Back to the Future 3, MI:1 and Speed. It is funny, action packed, polished and exhilarating. Harrison was great last week, but Tom is still the King. 9/10.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: I was lucky to be able to watch this 4 days before its official release in Czech Republic as a pre-premiere (didn't know such a thing existed) and it was the first time I've felt real excitement to go watch a film at the cinema in ages thanks to the recent genius combination of Fallout and Top Gun 2.I know what they were trying to do with this film. Bringing Kittridge back and a convoluted train finale all harked back to the 1st movie that sparked it all off. Explaining that convoluted storyline along the way harks back to the criticisms made about that same first film.The sky jump stunt was an attempt to beat the stunts from Tom Cruise in previous installments that have now become a beloved trademark of the franchise.But this film unfortunately overall is most reminiscent of the second installment which was Tom Cruise centric and lacked any real impossible mission requiring teamwork, real stakes and ingenious problem solving.In fact, it could have even been intentional that this film reminds the viewer of Mission Impossible 2. The photos in the film of past Ethan Hunt when searching for present Ethan Hunt show him with his longer hair as he looked in that second film.Ultimately, I expected the story to be way better than what we get in this instalment.There are 2 guys that keep appearing at each scene trying to catch Ethan which seems a very cheap simple story.And the very simple plot is explained in long scenes to make it seem way more complicated that it actually is (people complained there should be more explanation in the first film, but at least the plot in the first film actually required brain power), and I have to say that some of the acting is quite poor at times, not helped by some rather cheesy lines in the script, including the lines and accents in the opening Russian submarine sequence.There is also not that much action. 3 main action sequences for a close to 3 hour movie, which are the desert shoot out at the beginning, the Venice car chase, and the train crash at the end.I thought the alleyway fight scene, which some have praised, was really quite subpar and not very enthralling.The best action scene is the Venice car chase because it is genuinely funny (yes, because it is excellently laugh out loud funny, but not in any way tense); I never had the feeling that I was on the edge of my seat.The motorcycle sky jump scene was a major disappointment after the hype because if you didn't know Cruise actually did do that stunt, they used so much CGI that people would just assume it was computer generated. It actually reminded me of Pierce Brosnan's riding the tsunami in Die Another Day (sorry Tom! The stunt is still awesome!).The same for the train at the end. I know they actually made that train, and probably actually threw it off a bridge, but it doesn't look real. Though it is a long action finale and very fun to watch, for me the lack of realism takes away any tension. You are enjoying it for its visual value, but again not feeling any 'wow' factor or tension.At the end of Fallout, for example, you really felt Ethan Hunt was battered, bruised, worn out and still fighting to save humanity. There is none of that.The most tragic thing about this movie is that, unlike in the best of the previous films, we're back to the team being irrelevant in this one. Benji and Luther don't actually do very much.And poor Ilsa. Fallout ended with Ethan's ex-wife essentially giving him permission to move on and be with Ilsa.The relationship between Ilsa and Hunt had been built up over two excellent movies - Rogue Nation and Fallout - and in this film she says almost nothing, looks grumpy and sad all the time, and dies in an anticlimactic fight that is literally spelt out to the audience as a way to replace her with newcomer Grace.Grace, played by Hayley Atwell, is good. A likeable character and a capable actress, but I don't get the story unless Rebecca Ferguson said she wants out the franchise.The film is all about chasing \"the key.\" No twists. No high stakes. There is virtually no grittiness in this outing. It feels very light.Ultimately I was hoping to enjoy a quality film in the franchise. A movie like Oblivion, Edge of Tomorrow, Fallout, Top Gun 2 or American Made that you can show to anyone and say these are recent really high quality films starring this guy called Tom Cruise.This is not one of those films.It is more like The Mummy. It is better than Mission Impossible 2 but not better than any of the others in the franchise.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One confirms that Mission Impossible is the best franchise currently going and possibly ever made. A 2 hour 43 minute adrenaline rush that contains some of the best action sequences put to film, embarrasses the majority of the competition out there and sets the stage for a magnificent part 2 whilst still being a satisfying adventure in its own right.This is possibly the most open and obvious a Mission film has been with its deeper meaning for cinema and what aspect of Cruise's career is being dissected this time with a film that focuses on Ethan's relationship with women and basically outright declares AI to be a soulless monster and how the human element is always needed (perfect film to release during a writer's strike).Tom Cruise is perfect as Ethan Hunt and the strongest aspect this time round is when the film explores what made Ethan who he is and reminds you he genuinely cares about his team but that comes at a cost. Physically, the madman is still going strong with his stunts, driving a bike off a cliff in truly breathtaking fashion.Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg and Rebecca Ferguson remain the best IMF team and all play to their strengths here. The longer this series goes on the more authentic their growing friendship feels. Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis get more than expected and their buddy cop antics are a lot of fun.With Esai Morales' charismatic yet terrifying Gabriel and Pom Klementieff's terrific henchman of few words, this franchise finally has more good villains than bad. The return of Henry Czerny as Kittridge is glorious and he remains as gleefully despicable as his first appearance.The best new addition is easily Hayley Atwell. She plays a type of character never seen before in these films which makes her character and dynamic with Cruise fresh in comparison to everyone who's come before and their chemistry is magnetic. Instantaneous from the second they interact.Christopher McQuarrie's direction is phenomenal. The action sequences are suitably practical (this is how you spend $290 million), and the camera gets as close to the action as humanly possible, he remains one of the best in the business working at this scale. There's plenty of canted angles as a nice homage to De Palma's original and it helps give this one its own style in comparison to McQuarrie's previous entries.The pacing is really impressive with the film feeling like it's in a perpetual third act from its first airport heist (which is so much fun). Lorne Balfe does the music once again and yet again it's a highlight of the film, he knows how to elevate everything so well and really hammers home the emotional beats.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Ethan Hunt has left the mere secret agent status and has ascended to the all living perfect messiah.There is so much wrong with this movie, which seriously pains me because I seriously love this series. The mission impossible movies have steadily become more convoluted and more stupidly written. This film reaches the peak of absurdity, feeling more like an over the top fast and furious movie. All foolish action, cheap parlor tricks to pull the heart strings (empty relationships), horrible writing, poor plot development.I mean seriously what ever happened to show don't tell?! This is becoming rather ridiculous.*convoluted villain dialogue*\n",
            "\"So what you're telling me is you plan to establish a new world order if you get that key and if someone stops you that would be bad?!\"Has Ethan Hunt suddenly become this vanilla James Bond? With the Bond girl cycling through every few films? Lazy writing. Not natural feeling. Forced. BlighIt pains me to give this so low.The truth is, this movie is mindless entertaining action. Tom Cruise delivers on some awesome stunts (seldom compared to other MI films). It's not horrible. It's fun entertainment, but a scour on the (in my opinion) reputable authentic feeling mission impossible series.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: So you probably watched IM 6 and said, they can't make it any better can they? Or Top Gun 2, guess again, this is an adrenaline action movie with a good story, well written, action scenes that just blow you away, not a boring moment and you are on the edge of your seat all the time, this is how you make movies! Tom Cruise did it again, WOW!! It's an exhausting ride he takes you on, man I forgot to eat my popcorn and by the time i finally wanted some my wife had eaten all of it, but hey I was so immersed into the movie that time stood still and i forgot everything around me.Go and see it, this one gets my full recommendation, the only reason it's not a 10 is due to the fact it's not a completely new type of movie, however this one is done as a good action movie should be made, i don't see how they could have made it better, I really can't, go watch it and have a good time while you do it, it will put a big smile on your face that's for sure.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Am huge fan of MI franchise. The best part about all MI movies were how they plan and pull off an impossible mission. Thus I am quite disappointed on how this mission never seemed too difficult , let alone impossible.Action was okay. Car chase was funny, but not exciting. Jumping off the cliff seemed forced to me. Why would you keep driving uphill when you can take short cuts to reach the train. It wasn't even a fast train. The key kept being stolen from pockets too many times which makes you wonder how lazy the scripting was. Kill old gf to make new gf was also lazy writing.Unlike other MIs, Ethan had no single smart move or plan. It felt more like let's go and see what happens.Am not sure how MI fans ignored all these weaknesses and gave this film 8+ rating.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: This was a great movie. However, it lost a star from me for making the audience believe Ilsa is dead. They've spent two films building up Ilsa as being Ethan's equal, and hinted at an eventual romance. She's been able to fight off multiple men bare-handed yet she meets her demise by one guy when she has a sword? Then they brush past her death like it means nothing, only for her to be replaced by a new woman. I thought it was a huge disservice to the character.I know Rebecca Ferguson is very busy so she might have asked to leave, but I'm hoping this isn't the end for my favorite character in these films. She deserves a happy ending, or at least a better death than the one she received in this movie. It really took me out of the rest of the film. Hopefully, we'll see her again in Part Two.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Remember that classic MI scene where they broke in at CIA, and Cruise was hanging from the ceiling using wires? It's not a huge setpiece, but that scene is a nailbiting example of ingenious problem solving.In 'Dead Reckoning' there's none of that. Here it's keys changing hands every 10 minutes that is suppose to pass as suspense. And of course the only true selling point: the stunts performed by Tom Cruise.But I want and expect more than that.A large part of the film is devoted to people sitting or standing in a room, explaining what the plot is. Endless talking and explaining. We are told in several scenes the same information we just heard. Worst one is Benji, who is merely there to repeat things for someone in the cast, to make sure everyone in the audience knows what is going on. That is sloppy writing. One of the biggest no-no's as a screenwriter is resolving to \"so what you are saying is, that...\" info sharing. Benji does this all the time. And he is as incompetent as usual. And he is supposed to be a part of a small and unique team that is saving the world? Really?I hope MI:8 isn't just another Tom Cruise stunt reel where it looks like they make the story up as the go along, as long as all marks are checked in the end (running, face swapping, dealing with heights etc), and where character development takes a backseat. Bigger is not always better. And the action ALWAYS has to serve the story, not the other way around.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: After the first 30 minutes that promised an intellectual action thriller, the film starts its nosedive into mediocrity by introducing a thief who constantly indulges in disloyalty, for petty gains, towards the IMF and Hunt, but is held in high regards by Hunt. For the life of me, I couldn't understand why. The film also doesn't bother with it.Neither is it concerned with the so called action set pieces. _Fallout_ had plethora of those, one after the other, tied together by a cogent story line. For all its hype, it has 2-3 in a run time of close to 160 minutes, which tested my patience.Reading it's critics' reviews post viewing make me feel as if they have been written by the Entity, the AI behemoth at the center of this. The perceived entertainment value implied by them is not even remotely connected with the reality.It is no wonder that it is faltering at the US box office. It is no Top Gun- Maverick. Crowds are going to turn up, especially outside the US, because of Cruise's star power. But I don't believe this will please most of them.Disappointing.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: An absolute masterclass in producing an enjoyable action movie. Cinematography was great, the story was paced extremely well, and the casting of ALL roles was absolutely perfect.Cruise, Pegg and Rhames were awesome as always, Whigham and Davis were great additions, but the power quartet of Ferguson, Atwell, Klementieff and Kirby, really went above and beyond in making this movie perfect. Not to mention the chilling confidence of Morales as Gabriel, who practically oozes tangible danger.From the pre-opening credits scene to the final act, if you're like me, you will be on the edge of your seat - especially during any fight scene that involves Ferguson or Klementieff - and whilst there are moments that the tempo slows down to advance the story, it is always completely captivating.The single, solitary, disappointment comes as the credits roll, and you remember you're going to have to wait until next year to see how it ends.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Absolutely superb! Was hoping they could do the impossible and surpass Fallout! And Cruise, McQuarrie and co have accomplished this in spades, delivering the best spy/ action thriller in years.It is a next level masterclass of a film, with everything you would expect from an Mission Impossible film and more.The cast are great, with the new additions adding so much to the usual MI crew. The stunts are performed to the usual high standard and give you that Wow feeling you want, The story is fantastic, leaving you wanting more, setting up Part Two really wellGo see this on the best screen possible.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: It should be impossible to fumble the bag so badly on a nostalgia trip movie like this. Just let Tom Cruise run, do some crazy stunts and play the iconic theme music. But no they gotta drag on for three hours with a meaningless storyline just for it to be one part of an incomplete movie. Like whatever happened to movie editing? There's no reason for this movie to be this long and a lot of the content is completely unnecessary to move the plot forward. I don't expect MI movies to have watertight logic but then atleast the writers shouldn't twist themselves into knots thinking they're making a deeper movie than they are, the sooner these movie trends with AI, quantum space tunneling, multiverse nonsense end the better it is for good storylines.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: This latest Mission: Impossible movie is a slam dunk that needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible. Tom Cruise certainly knows how to make a movie. In another universe Cruse could have been Iron Man and I always felt that his aggression with the Mission: Impossible franchise was his way of making up for that. That's probably why the dialog in this movie felt like Ethan Hawk was captain America or something and they are going up against a Bonafede supervillain in the form of an A. I system. As far as I'm concern the best villain of the franchise snice the late and great Phillip Seymour Huffman.The Avengers Assemble as franchise regulars Simon Pegg as Dunn and Ving Rhimes, who I say with glee, started this franchise with Cruse as Luther, make their return as IMF agents. Rebecca Ferguson reprises her role from the last movie and Haley Atwell is in the movie as well, but none of this makes me as happy as Ving still being in the franchise.The action sequences are so good in this picture. It was worth having to stay in me seat for almost three hours just so they can add a little more action in-between the Hero's journey dialogue.And this is just part one!? Part two has some big shoes to fill!\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: I love Tom Cruise movies, but this one feels pretty contrived. Beyond the plot, Grace was the biggest detriment to the movie. The character started out amusing but her shtick became insufferable and Ethan's infatuation idiotic. How they handled Ilsa feels both rushed and cheap, with no emotional weight felt. The biggest stunt was spoiled beforehand which I suppose did its job in getting me in the seat, but totally ruins the moment in film. The final act also lacked any tension and was honestly a little boring - there wasn't any real cleverness.Still, it was humorous throughout, had a good amount of charm and the production value is evident. That's enough for me to be above average but it's unlikely I'll watch the followup in theater.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: As a hardout Mission fan. I can confirm 5 years was definitely worth the wait. The film is extremally charming and filled with exciting humor, action and story-telling. Tom and Hayley really bring the film so much joy and create wonderful chemistry. The chase scene in Rome puts you on the edge of your seat and nothing prepares you for the daring things Tom and Hayley pull off in the train sequence.. Tom really understands the action genre and did not disappoint with this film. There is a perfect blend between foundation building for the story and the action sequences. The film is a beautiful set up to the part 2 coming next year.. Brilliant Watch 100/10.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Straight up Dead Reckoning Part 1 was fine. I think it's the weakest out of the last four instalments.I can't put my finger on one exact thing but it just felt a little underdone compared to the last few M:I and was expecting big things the whole movie. It was a combination of things like the acting felt a little weak I guess, the script was just fine, the action was decent but not great compared to other M:I and to the likes of John Wick that I'm now used to. The plot with the A. I is nothing new but it's always still interesting and especially at a time in the real world where the advancements seem to be heating up but the whole pickpocketing the key for 2 hours also got boring so fast. Too many cliches started piling up. The hand to hand combat was some of the weakest stuff I've seen it a while especially the Venice bridge scene, it looked awful, like I could see the choreography. The best scene for me was the desert storm at the start which really had my attention but everything after that seemed just average.I don't know if everyone else is now completely over their only trick being having someone go as someone else with these masks. It's so boring to me now and at a stage I'm kinda rolling my eyes. I really hope the machine blowing a fuse means we have seen the last of them.Tom Cruise is awesome with the stunts he does and will always have respect for the things him doing them but I really wish they didn't show the motorbike cliff jump scene in the trailer. What you see in the trailer is literally the whole stunt, don't get me wrong it's truly impressive but they showed the whole thing and just completely killed it for me.I'm slightly bummed with this one and just coming off seeing Indian Jones and having a lot more fun watching that. I don't care about runtimes but you have to have me sucked in and the whole time, I felt the time...People will love this movie but M:I may have fizzled out with me a bit after this one.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Greetings again from the darkness. The challenge in continuing the \"Mission: Impossible\" franchise is that fans expect each entry to be \"bigger\" and more awe-inspiring than the last. With the seventh film in the series, and the third straight he has directed, writer-director Christopher McQuarrie and superstar actor and daredevil Tom Cruise have managed to accomplish what seemed unlikely ... they have delivered Ethan Hunt's biggest and grandest mission yet. Prepare to be awed by the action.You should know that this is \"Part One\" and it runs 163 minutes, a full hour longer than most movies, and exponentially more expensive to produce. All this during an age when ultra-high-budget blockbusters are being rumored to be fading from public interest. Of course, we are only one year removed from Tom Cruise's TOP GUN: MAVERICK being credited with 'saving cinema', so stay on alert for a 'sky is falling' panic. McQuarrie co-wrote the script with Erik Jendresen (\"Band of Brothers\"), and they remain faithful to the characters and storylines established by the TV series creator, Bruce Geller.There may never have been an actor more suited to a recurring role than Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt (Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones might be the closest). The story itself is fairly straightforward, even if the item being chased often feels like a MacGuffin. Your questioning of how a 'simple' spy-thriller can be effective is understandable, yet it's fascinating to watch as Ethan Hunt's mission in life as an agent is evaluated, as is the cost he's paid as a man. Providing a contemporary theme, the obscure object of desire is an all-powerful key (actually two parts of a key) based on controlling an all-encompassing Artificial Intelligence (AI).In a twist on a familiar theme (and a classic comedy film), we have Airports, Trains, and EVs, the latter being a tiny Fiat with handcuffs. Still, the car chase is everything we might hope, while the high-tech facial search in the airport sequence delivers the thrills for techie viewers, and the train sparring occurs inside as well as on top. And lest you be worried, there are enough Cruise sprint scenes here to put CHARIOTS OF FIRE to shame.Familiar faces include Ethan Hunt's team of Luther (Ving Rhames, who along with Cruise, has appeared in all 7 MI films), Benji (Simon Pegg), and Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). It's nice to again see (and hear) Henry Czerny as Kittridge, Vanessa Kirby as arms dealer The White Widow, and Esai Morales - as Gabriel, the required villain in search of the same key as our good guys. New faces include Haylee Atwell as master pickpocket Grace, whose soul may or may not be beyond salvation; Cary Elwes as agency director Denlinger; Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis as officers after rogue Hunt; and Pom Klementieff as a hired assassin.The stunt work here is outstanding, and of course, Tom Cruise is renowned for personally handling many of the most breathtaking acts - the most memorable one here being his riding of a motorcycle off a cliff. This stunt has a 'making of' video that's been available for a while. As movie goers, we've never seen anything like it. This part one was originally scheduled for release in 2021 (thanks a lot, COVID), and now Part Two is set for 2024. It's been 27 years since the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE (1996) with Jon Voight ... Cruise was 34 in that one. This particular mission is the biggest yet, and it would certainly be impossible for the rest of us. It's a mission that will be closed out in Part Two, and simultaneously bring an end to Cruise's remarkable run as Ethan Hunt.Opening July 12, 2023.\n",

I am a big fan of the MI movies (including MI2, which people seem to hate) and I could appreciate this movie for the few scenes that it did right, but it treats the audience like idiots in its bland, repetitive storyline (how many times do we need to hear the words \"the key\" and \"the entity\"? It was as if the writers of this movie just gave up on their jobs when they wrote this. Easily the weakest MI movie ever filmed. It had me staring at my watch every 20 minutes. As others have mentioned, the character development in this movie is also truly awful. I have barely any interest in seeing Part Two of Dead Reckoning at this point. The high scores this movie is getting absolutely baffle me. This movie by no means deserves a score higher than a 6 or a 6.5.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Basically, this movie is big, loud, and stupid.Definitely TOO loud, in fact. The music attempts to turn even the most minor scene into some sort of heart-pounding climax.There are endless ridiculous fights in which Tom Cruise is predictably unstoppable, no matter how many opponents he's up against. Slim girls get to beat up multiple men. (Emily Blunt was right when, commenting on a fight in \"Sicario\" in which, refreshingly, she loses to a bigger guy, she noted that Hollywood fight scenes in which 110-pound women whip larger males are \"so cheesy.\")The dull, tepid, way-too-pretty villain is, implausibly, a formidable fighter but sure doesn't look like one. An action movie is only as good as its villain is evil; this guy looks like a French fashion mogul.He and Cruise fight on top of -- wait for it -- a moving train! Haven't we seen that ridiculous sort of thing a hundred times before?The tediously overcomplicated plot makes it hard to keep track of who's on which side, nor do we care. Apparently, as is usual these days, we're supposed to root against the U. S. government.In all scenes involving conversations, virtually EVERY line is merely plot exposition in which characters tell us, in stilted dialogue, what's going on, what's supposed to happen, and how we're supposed to feel.The much-touted parachute jump is actually disappointing. It's over quite fast, and its main source of interest is that, if you've seen the promotional video, you know that Cruise himself actually made that jump.The only truly enjoyable sequence -- the cleverly worked-out rescue attempts on the falling train -- comes at the end, after nearly two and a half hours of empty cartoonish nonsense...Including, of course, an overlong cartoonish car chase, obligatory in dumb summer movies.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: The latest Mission: Impossible film is a part one of two story but finishes in a satisfying way rather than annoying and you won't feel hard done by.It's another great big screen action film that we've come to expect. It feels huge the whole time however I must say I while the set pieces were stellar, the hand to hand combat scenes were not great and a big step down from the last film (Fallout).Thebeginning is slow with a lot of expository being dumped (more than you'd usually see) but once it gets going it is pretty nonstop.This is a good chapter and Haley Atwell shines but it is nowhere near my favorite of the series.7/10Mi rankingsMi6 Fallout\n",

            "Skipping non-numeric rating: 'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part I (M:I7) is another strong entry in the action/spy series, with Ethan (Cruise) looking slightly older, but not less determined to save the world. I believe the sequel to this film will be his last outing - but we'll see. This time, there's some Skynet-like sentient-AI that's manipulating nefarious types to take over the world, so the IMF team are out to get the two halves of key that can stop it.Isla (Ferguson), Benji (Pegg) and Luther (Rhames) are back, as well as CIA boss Kittridge (Czerny), with Grace (Atwell), a thief, being the newcomer. The bad guys that keep thwarting them are Gabriel (Morales) from Ethan's past, and Paris (Klementieff). The consistency of having McQuarrie as director of the two previous films helps, with everything feeling assured and this working as a really solid follow-up to 'Fallout'.There's some funny moments, some sincere ones, and some of Ethan running, as contractually-obliged. The whole final scene on the train is excellent, with so many things happening, but there's plenty of good set-pieces throughout, including a good car chase. However, the piece-de-resistance is the motorbike off the cliff into a BASE jump is something else. The fact Cruise did it for real, multiple times, is crazy and inspiring.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Man.... I wish I loved this movie more than I did. Don't get me wrong, it's a solid action movie with jaw-dropping stunts (some of the best in the series), but as a Mission: Impossible movie, it felt like a small step backward for the franchise. Fallout had mind-blowing action sequences and stunt work, along with developing Ethan's relationship with Ilsa, providing closure with Julia, showing the lengths Ethan would go to protect those closest to him, and battling an imposing villain. Dead Reckoning: Part One stretches the movie across two films only to seemingly showcase action spectacle after action spectacle while sacrificing character development. Characters I have grown to love over a decade of films felt sidelined, ignored, or wasted. Hayley Atwell's new character chewed up most of the screen time, and while she was fantastic, I wanted to see more of the original team. The new villain had an inconsistent ability that confused more than intimidated. There were some important emotional moments that I just didn't feel the weight of when I definitely should have. Part Two might tie everything together and make me enjoy Part One more in retrospect, but unfortunately, I left wanting more from this one.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Just got out of seeing this movie. I am really disappointed that they totally killed off the potential relationship between Ethan and Ilsa. I am totally OK with her dying but the way that they did it and how anti-climactic it was after building up her character so much in the previous two films. Just seems like she would've deserved a better death than that. Also, what was the point of showing the two characters getting closer to each other, and in the last film, his ex-wife, basically giving them permission to move forward when you're just going to kill her off like that. Honestly, Rebecca Ferguson revised this franchise two movies ago and I think killing off her character was a big mistake. Even in the scenes that she's in it doesn't even seem like she's playing the same person. I wonder if they wrote her out of the movie because she's too busy with the rest of her work. Hayley Atwell's character doesn't make sense to me either. Just put her in the IMF because she can pick some pockets? This all seems forced. Maybe most won't agree, but I think this development totally ruined the movie for me.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Just saw this one in a theatre, and boy... what an adrenaline rush it is. The latest Mission Impossible features some of the most incredible stunts ever put to camera. The story is absolutely exhilarating and continues to bring new life to a veteran movie franchise. The sheer scale of this movie is epic, and with every twist and turn of the movie, you cannot help but marvel at the incredible sets used to bring this movie to life. Such a movie begs to be seen on the biggest screen possible where you can truly feel the grandeur of the film. Tom Cruise has once again delivered one of the best movies of the year, and I cannot recommend that you see it enough!\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: To me, a new M:I film is an event. From Part 4 onwards, they've been spectacular (all 10/10's).There's some good stuff here for sure, and overall it's a solid 8, but it's simply not as good as previous entries.I kept noticing that a lot of scenes had just 2 or 3 people in them, and I kept imagining the crew all masked up, as well as the cast when the camera wasn't on them. It can't be easy to make a huge movie like this during a pandemic, but it definitely shows.The A. I. plot is quite good, and Hunt's as-yet-unknown backstory quite intriguing, but the whole story basically revolves around: \"I've got the key, now she's got the key, now he's got the key\" etc. So much pick-pocketing.Also, I really wish they hadn't ruined the motorcycle jump in the promos. If you've seen the promo, you've seen the scene. There are really only 3 or 4 action sequences, and nothing we haven't really seen before. I actually enjoyed the first desert shoot-out the best.And- oh!- the exposition! There's a scene near the beginning that reminded me of a Neil Breen(!) movie, where powerful people sit in a room and just spout buzz words like \"nuclear war,\" \"economic collapse,\" \"dogs and cats living together\" etc.THAT said, it's still an 8/10. Tom always gives it his best, the rest of the cast is good (especially all four female leads) and I thought the added humour with Hunt's character was a nice touch. I'd rather watch this ten times over than any blatant cyncial Disney cash-grab.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Good God. I feel ashamed for approaching this film with a modicum of doubt that Tom would still be able to deliver. Unbelievably, this epic actually manages to top the brilliant Fallout. Tom is literally going to die if he keeps doing these stunts. The motorbike sequence is utterly ludicrous. Intriguing plot with actual stakes and some familiar faces ably supported by brilliant new allies and villains. Sets up Part II perfectly with a sensational finale that homages Back to the Future 3, MI:1 and Speed. It is funny, action packed, polished and exhilarating. Harrison was great last week, but Tom is still the King. 9/10.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: I was lucky to be able to watch this 4 days before its official release in Czech Republic as a pre-premiere (didn't know such a thing existed) and it was the first time I've felt real excitement to go watch a film at the cinema in ages thanks to the recent genius combination of Fallout and Top Gun 2.I know what they were trying to do with this film. Bringing Kittridge back and a convoluted train finale all harked back to the 1st movie that sparked it all off. Explaining that convoluted storyline along the way harks back to the criticisms made about that same first film.The sky jump stunt was an attempt to beat the stunts from Tom Cruise in previous installments that have now become a beloved trademark of the franchise.But this film unfortunately overall is most reminiscent of the second installment which was Tom Cruise centric and lacked any real impossible mission requiring teamwork, real stakes and ingenious problem solving.In fact, it could have even been intentional that this film reminds the viewer of Mission Impossible 2. The photos in the film of past Ethan Hunt when searching for present Ethan Hunt show him with his longer hair as he looked in that second film.Ultimately, I expected the story to be way better than what we get in this instalment.There are 2 guys that keep appearing at each scene trying to catch Ethan which seems a very cheap simple story.And the very simple plot is explained in long scenes to make it seem way more complicated that it actually is (people complained there should be more explanation in the first film, but at least the plot in the first film actually required brain power), and I have to say that some of the acting is quite poor at times, not helped by some rather cheesy lines in the script, including the lines and accents in the opening Russian submarine sequence.There is also not that much action. 3 main action sequences for a close to 3 hour movie, which are the desert shoot out at the beginning, the Venice car chase, and the train crash at the end.I thought the alleyway fight scene, which some have praised, was really quite subpar and not very enthralling.The best action scene is the Venice car chase because it is genuinely funny (yes, because it is excellently laugh out loud funny, but not in any way tense); I never had the feeling that I was on the edge of my seat.The motorcycle sky jump scene was a major disappointment after the hype because if you didn't know Cruise actually did do that stunt, they used so much CGI that people would just assume it was computer generated. It actually reminded me of Pierce Brosnan's riding the tsunami in Die Another Day (sorry Tom! The stunt is still awesome!).The same for the train at the end. I know they actually made that train, and probably actually threw it off a bridge, but it doesn't look real. Though it is a long action finale and very fun to watch, for me the lack of realism takes away any tension. You are enjoying it for its visual value, but again not feeling any 'wow' factor or tension.At the end of Fallout, for example, you really felt Ethan Hunt was battered, bruised, worn out and still fighting to save humanity. There is none of that.The most tragic thing about this movie is that, unlike in the best of the previous films, we're back to the team being irrelevant in this one. Benji and Luther don't actually do very much.And poor Ilsa. Fallout ended with Ethan's ex-wife essentially giving him permission to move on and be with Ilsa.The relationship between Ilsa and Hunt had been built up over two excellent movies - Rogue Nation and Fallout - and in this film she says almost nothing, looks grumpy and sad all the time, and dies in an anticlimactic fight that is literally spelt out to the audience as a way to replace her with newcomer Grace.Grace, played by Hayley Atwell, is good. A likeable character and a capable actress, but I don't get the story unless Rebecca Ferguson said she wants out the franchise.The film is all about chasing \"the key.\" No twists. No high stakes. There is virtually no grittiness in this outing. It feels very light.Ultimately I was hoping to enjoy a quality film in the franchise. A movie like Oblivion, Edge of Tomorrow, Fallout, Top Gun 2 or American Made that you can show to anyone and say these are recent really high quality films starring this guy called Tom Cruise.This is not one of those films.It is more like The Mummy. It is better than Mission Impossible 2 but not better than any of the others in the franchise.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One confirms that Mission Impossible is the best franchise currently going and possibly ever made. A 2 hour 43 minute adrenaline rush that contains some of the best action sequences put to film, embarrasses the majority of the competition out there and sets the stage for a magnificent part 2 whilst still being a satisfying adventure in its own right.This is possibly the most open and obvious a Mission film has been with its deeper meaning for cinema and what aspect of Cruise's career is being dissected this time with a film that focuses on Ethan's relationship with women and basically outright declares AI to be a soulless monster and how the human element is always needed (perfect film to release during a writer's strike).Tom Cruise is perfect as Ethan Hunt and the strongest aspect this time round is when the film explores what made Ethan who he is and reminds you he genuinely cares about his team but that comes at a cost. Physically, the madman is still going strong with his stunts, driving a bike off a cliff in truly breathtaking fashion.Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg and Rebecca Ferguson remain the best IMF team and all play to their strengths here. The longer this series goes on the more authentic their growing friendship feels. Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis get more than expected and their buddy cop antics are a lot of fun.With Esai Morales' charismatic yet terrifying Gabriel and Pom Klementieff's terrific henchman of few words, this franchise finally has more good villains than bad. The return of Henry Czerny as Kittridge is glorious and he remains as gleefully despicable as his first appearance.The best new addition is easily Hayley Atwell. She plays a type of character never seen before in these films which makes her character and dynamic with Cruise fresh in comparison to everyone who's come before and their chemistry is magnetic. Instantaneous from the second they interact.Christopher McQuarrie's direction is phenomenal. The action sequences are suitably practical (this is how you spend $290 million), and the camera gets as close to the action as humanly possible, he remains one of the best in the business working at this scale. There's plenty of canted angles as a nice homage to De Palma's original and it helps give this one its own style in comparison to McQuarrie's previous entries.The pacing is really impressive with the film feeling like it's in a perpetual third act from its first airport heist (which is so much fun). Lorne Balfe does the music once again and yet again it's a highlight of the film, he knows how to elevate everything so well and really hammers home the emotional beats.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Ethan Hunt has left the mere secret agent status and has ascended to the all living perfect messiah.There is so much wrong with this movie, which seriously pains me because I seriously love this series. The mission impossible movies have steadily become more convoluted and more stupidly written. This film reaches the peak of absurdity, feeling more like an over the top fast and furious movie. All foolish action, cheap parlor tricks to pull the heart strings (empty relationships), horrible writing, poor plot development.I mean seriously what ever happened to show don't tell?! This is becoming rather ridiculous.*convoluted villain dialogue*\n",
            "\"So what you're telling me is you plan to establish a new world order if you get that key and if someone stops you that would be bad?!\"Has Ethan Hunt suddenly become this vanilla James Bond? With the Bond girl cycling through every few films? Lazy writing. Not natural feeling. Forced. BlighIt pains me to give this so low.The truth is, this movie is mindless entertaining action. Tom Cruise delivers on some awesome stunts (seldom compared to other MI films). It's not horrible. It's fun entertainment, but a scour on the (in my opinion) reputable authentic feeling mission impossible series.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: So you probably watched IM 6 and said, they can't make it any better can they? Or Top Gun 2, guess again, this is an adrenaline action movie with a good story, well written, action scenes that just blow you away, not a boring moment and you are on the edge of your seat all the time, this is how you make movies! Tom Cruise did it again, WOW!! It's an exhausting ride he takes you on, man I forgot to eat my popcorn and by the time i finally wanted some my wife had eaten all of it, but hey I was so immersed into the movie that time stood still and i forgot everything around me.Go and see it, this one gets my full recommendation, the only reason it's not a 10 is due to the fact it's not a completely new type of movie, however this one is done as a good action movie should be made, i don't see how they could have made it better, I really can't, go watch it and have a good time while you do it, it will put a big smile on your face that's for sure.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Am huge fan of MI franchise. The best part about all MI movies were how they plan and pull off an impossible mission. Thus I am quite disappointed on how this mission never seemed too difficult , let alone impossible.Action was okay. Car chase was funny, but not exciting. Jumping off the cliff seemed forced to me. Why would you keep driving uphill when you can take short cuts to reach the train. It wasn't even a fast train. The key kept being stolen from pockets too many times which makes you wonder how lazy the scripting was. Kill old gf to make new gf was also lazy writing.Unlike other MIs, Ethan had no single smart move or plan. It felt more like let's go and see what happens.Am not sure how MI fans ignored all these weaknesses and gave this film 8+ rating.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: This was a great movie. However, it lost a star from me for making the audience believe Ilsa is dead. They've spent two films building up Ilsa as being Ethan's equal, and hinted at an eventual romance. She's been able to fight off multiple men bare-handed yet she meets her demise by one guy when she has a sword? Then they brush past her death like it means nothing, only for her to be replaced by a new woman. I thought it was a huge disservice to the character.I know Rebecca Ferguson is very busy so she might have asked to leave, but I'm hoping this isn't the end for my favorite character in these films. She deserves a happy ending, or at least a better death than the one she received in this movie. It really took me out of the rest of the film. Hopefully, we'll see her again in Part Two.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Remember that classic MI scene where they broke in at CIA, and Cruise was hanging from the ceiling using wires? It's not a huge setpiece, but that scene is a nailbiting example of ingenious problem solving.In 'Dead Reckoning' there's none of that. Here it's keys changing hands every 10 minutes that is suppose to pass as suspense. And of course the only true selling point: the stunts performed by Tom Cruise.But I want and expect more than that.A large part of the film is devoted to people sitting or standing in a room, explaining what the plot is. Endless talking and explaining. We are told in several scenes the same information we just heard. Worst one is Benji, who is merely there to repeat things for someone in the cast, to make sure everyone in the audience knows what is going on. That is sloppy writing. One of the biggest no-no's as a screenwriter is resolving to \"so what you are saying is, that...\" info sharing. Benji does this all the time. And he is as incompetent as usual. And he is supposed to be a part of a small and unique team that is saving the world? Really?I hope MI:8 isn't just another Tom Cruise stunt reel where it looks like they make the story up as the go along, as long as all marks are checked in the end (running, face swapping, dealing with heights etc), and where character development takes a backseat. Bigger is not always better. And the action ALWAYS has to serve the story, not the other way around.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: After the first 30 minutes that promised an intellectual action thriller, the film starts its nosedive into mediocrity by introducing a thief who constantly indulges in disloyalty, for petty gains, towards the IMF and Hunt, but is held in high regards by Hunt. For the life of me, I couldn't understand why. The film also doesn't bother with it.Neither is it concerned with the so called action set pieces. _Fallout_ had plethora of those, one after the other, tied together by a cogent story line. For all its hype, it has 2-3 in a run time of close to 160 minutes, which tested my patience.Reading it's critics' reviews post viewing make me feel as if they have been written by the Entity, the AI behemoth at the center of this. The perceived entertainment value implied by them is not even remotely connected with the reality.It is no wonder that it is faltering at the US box office. It is no Top Gun- Maverick. Crowds are going to turn up, especially outside the US, because of Cruise's star power. But I don't believe this will please most of them.Disappointing.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: An absolute masterclass in producing an enjoyable action movie. Cinematography was great, the story was paced extremely well, and the casting of ALL roles was absolutely perfect.Cruise, Pegg and Rhames were awesome as always, Whigham and Davis were great additions, but the power quartet of Ferguson, Atwell, Klementieff and Kirby, really went above and beyond in making this movie perfect. Not to mention the chilling confidence of Morales as Gabriel, who practically oozes tangible danger.From the pre-opening credits scene to the final act, if you're like me, you will be on the edge of your seat - especially during any fight scene that involves Ferguson or Klementieff - and whilst there are moments that the tempo slows down to advance the story, it is always completely captivating.The single, solitary, disappointment comes as the credits roll, and you remember you're going to have to wait until next year to see how it ends.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Absolutely superb! Was hoping they could do the impossible and surpass Fallout! And Cruise, McQuarrie and co have accomplished this in spades, delivering the best spy/ action thriller in years.It is a next level masterclass of a film, with everything you would expect from an Mission Impossible film and more.The cast are great, with the new additions adding so much to the usual MI crew. The stunts are performed to the usual high standard and give you that Wow feeling you want, The story is fantastic, leaving you wanting more, setting up Part Two really wellGo see this on the best screen possible.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: It should be impossible to fumble the bag so badly on a nostalgia trip movie like this. Just let Tom Cruise run, do some crazy stunts and play the iconic theme music. But no they gotta drag on for three hours with a meaningless storyline just for it to be one part of an incomplete movie. Like whatever happened to movie editing? There's no reason for this movie to be this long and a lot of the content is completely unnecessary to move the plot forward. I don't expect MI movies to have watertight logic but then atleast the writers shouldn't twist themselves into knots thinking they're making a deeper movie than they are, the sooner these movie trends with AI, quantum space tunneling, multiverse nonsense end the better it is for good storylines.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: This latest Mission: Impossible movie is a slam dunk that needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible. Tom Cruise certainly knows how to make a movie. In another universe Cruse could have been Iron Man and I always felt that his aggression with the Mission: Impossible franchise was his way of making up for that. That's probably why the dialog in this movie felt like Ethan Hawk was captain America or something and they are going up against a Bonafede supervillain in the form of an A. I system. As far as I'm concern the best villain of the franchise snice the late and great Phillip Seymour Huffman.The Avengers Assemble as franchise regulars Simon Pegg as Dunn and Ving Rhimes, who I say with glee, started this franchise with Cruse as Luther, make their return as IMF agents. Rebecca Ferguson reprises her role from the last movie and Haley Atwell is in the movie as well, but none of this makes me as happy as Ving still being in the franchise.The action sequences are so good in this picture. It was worth having to stay in me seat for almost three hours just so they can add a little more action in-between the Hero's journey dialogue.And this is just part one!? Part two has some big shoes to fill!\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: I love Tom Cruise movies, but this one feels pretty contrived. Beyond the plot, Grace was the biggest detriment to the movie. The character started out amusing but her shtick became insufferable and Ethan's infatuation idiotic. How they handled Ilsa feels both rushed and cheap, with no emotional weight felt. The biggest stunt was spoiled beforehand which I suppose did its job in getting me in the seat, but totally ruins the moment in film. The final act also lacked any tension and was honestly a little boring - there wasn't any real cleverness.Still, it was humorous throughout, had a good amount of charm and the production value is evident. That's enough for me to be above average but it's unlikely I'll watch the followup in theater.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: As a hardout Mission fan. I can confirm 5 years was definitely worth the wait. The film is extremally charming and filled with exciting humor, action and story-telling. Tom and Hayley really bring the film so much joy and create wonderful chemistry. The chase scene in Rome puts you on the edge of your seat and nothing prepares you for the daring things Tom and Hayley pull off in the train sequence.. Tom really understands the action genre and did not disappoint with this film. There is a perfect blend between foundation building for the story and the action sequences. The film is a beautiful set up to the part 2 coming next year.. Brilliant Watch 100/10.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Straight up Dead Reckoning Part 1 was fine. I think it's the weakest out of the last four instalments.I can't put my finger on one exact thing but it just felt a little underdone compared to the last few M:I and was expecting big things the whole movie. It was a combination of things like the acting felt a little weak I guess, the script was just fine, the action was decent but not great compared to other M:I and to the likes of John Wick that I'm now used to. The plot with the A. I is nothing new but it's always still interesting and especially at a time in the real world where the advancements seem to be heating up but the whole pickpocketing the key for 2 hours also got boring so fast. Too many cliches started piling up. The hand to hand combat was some of the weakest stuff I've seen it a while especially the Venice bridge scene, it looked awful, like I could see the choreography. The best scene for me was the desert storm at the start which really had my attention but everything after that seemed just average.I don't know if everyone else is now completely over their only trick being having someone go as someone else with these masks. It's so boring to me now and at a stage I'm kinda rolling my eyes. I really hope the machine blowing a fuse means we have seen the last of them.Tom Cruise is awesome with the stunts he does and will always have respect for the things him doing them but I really wish they didn't show the motorbike cliff jump scene in the trailer. What you see in the trailer is literally the whole stunt, don't get me wrong it's truly impressive but they showed the whole thing and just completely killed it for me.I'm slightly bummed with this one and just coming off seeing Indian Jones and having a lot more fun watching that. I don't care about runtimes but you have to have me sucked in and the whole time, I felt the time...People will love this movie but M:I may have fizzled out with me a bit after this one.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Greetings again from the darkness. The challenge in continuing the \"Mission: Impossible\" franchise is that fans expect each entry to be \"bigger\" and more awe-inspiring than the last. With the seventh film in the series, and the third straight he has directed, writer-director Christopher McQuarrie and superstar actor and daredevil Tom Cruise have managed to accomplish what seemed unlikely ... they have delivered Ethan Hunt's biggest and grandest mission yet. Prepare to be awed by the action.You should know that this is \"Part One\" and it runs 163 minutes, a full hour longer than most movies, and exponentially more expensive to produce. All this during an age when ultra-high-budget blockbusters are being rumored to be fading from public interest. Of course, we are only one year removed from Tom Cruise's TOP GUN: MAVERICK being credited with 'saving cinema', so stay on alert for a 'sky is falling' panic. McQuarrie co-wrote the script with Erik Jendresen (\"Band of Brothers\"), and they remain faithful to the characters and storylines established by the TV series creator, Bruce Geller.There may never have been an actor more suited to a recurring role than Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt (Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones might be the closest). The story itself is fairly straightforward, even if the item being chased often feels like a MacGuffin. Your questioning of how a 'simple' spy-thriller can be effective is understandable, yet it's fascinating to watch as Ethan Hunt's mission in life as an agent is evaluated, as is the cost he's paid as a man. Providing a contemporary theme, the obscure object of desire is an all-powerful key (actually two parts of a key) based on controlling an all-encompassing Artificial Intelligence (AI).In a twist on a familiar theme (and a classic comedy film), we have Airports, Trains, and EVs, the latter being a tiny Fiat with handcuffs. Still, the car chase is everything we might hope, while the high-tech facial search in the airport sequence delivers the thrills for techie viewers, and the train sparring occurs inside as well as on top. And lest you be worried, there are enough Cruise sprint scenes here to put CHARIOTS OF FIRE to shame.Familiar faces include Ethan Hunt's team of Luther (Ving Rhames, who along with Cruise, has appeared in all 7 MI films), Benji (Simon Pegg), and Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). It's nice to again see (and hear) Henry Czerny as Kittridge, Vanessa Kirby as arms dealer The White Widow, and Esai Morales - as Gabriel, the required villain in search of the same key as our good guys. New faces include Haylee Atwell as master pickpocket Grace, whose soul may or may not be beyond salvation; Cary Elwes as agency director Denlinger; Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis as officers after rogue Hunt; and Pom Klementieff as a hired assassin.The stunt work here is outstanding, and of course, Tom Cruise is renowned for personally handling many of the most breathtaking acts - the most memorable one here being his riding of a motorcycle off a cliff. This stunt has a 'making of' video that's been available for a while. As movie goers, we've never seen anything like it. This part one was originally scheduled for release in 2021 (thanks a lot, COVID), and now Part Two is set for 2024. It's been 27 years since the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE (1996) with Jon Voight ... Cruise was 34 in that one. This particular mission is the biggest yet, and it would certainly be impossible for the rest of us. It's a mission that will be closed out in Part Two, and simultaneously bring an end to Cruise's remarkable run as Ethan Hunt.Opening July 12, 2023.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: This movie started out promising but by the end, it just felt like being robbed of two and a half hours. I am a big fan of the MI movies (including MI2, which people seem to hate) and I could appreciate this movie for the few scenes that it did right, but it treats the audience like idiots in its bland, repetitive storyline (how many times do we need to hear the words \"the key\" and \"the entity\"? It was as if the writers of this movie just gave up on their jobs when they wrote this. Easily the weakest MI movie ever filmed. It had me staring at my watch every 20 minutes. As others have mentioned, the character development in this movie is also truly awful. I have barely any interest in seeing Part Two of Dead Reckoning at this point. The high scores this movie is getting absolutely baffle me. This movie by no means deserves a score higher than a 6 or a 6.5.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Basically, this movie is big, loud, and stupid.Definitely TOO loud, in fact. The music attempts to turn even the most minor scene into some sort of heart-pounding climax.There are endless ridiculous fights in which Tom Cruise is predictably unstoppable, no matter how many opponents he's up against. Slim girls get to beat up multiple men. (Emily Blunt was right when, commenting on a fight in \"Sicario\" in which, refreshingly, she loses to a bigger guy, she noted that Hollywood fight scenes in which 110-pound women whip larger males are \"so cheesy.\")The dull, tepid, way-too-pretty villain is, implausibly, a formidable fighter but sure doesn't look like one. An action movie is only as good as its villain is evil; this guy looks like a French fashion mogul.He and Cruise fight on top of -- wait for it -- a moving train! Haven't we seen that ridiculous sort of thing a hundred times before?The tediously overcomplicated plot makes it hard to keep track of who's on which side, nor do we care. Apparently, as is usual these days, we're supposed to root against the U. S. government.In all scenes involving conversations, virtually EVERY line is merely plot exposition in which characters tell us, in stilted dialogue, what's going on, what's supposed to happen, and how we're supposed to feel.The much-touted parachute jump is actually disappointing. It's over quite fast, and its main source of interest is that, if you've seen the promotional video, you know that Cruise himself actually made that jump.The only truly enjoyable sequence -- the cleverly worked-out rescue attempts on the falling train -- comes at the end, after nearly two and a half hours of empty cartoonish nonsense...Including, of course, an overlong cartoonish car chase, obligatory in dumb summer movies.\n",

It feels huge the whole time however I must say I while the set pieces were stellar, the hand to hand combat scenes were not great and a big step down from the last film (Fallout).Thebeginning is slow with a lot of expository being dumped (more than you'd usually see) but once it gets going it is pretty nonstop.This is a good chapter and Haley Atwell shines but it is nowhere near my favorite of the series.7/10Mi rankingsMi6 Fallout\n",

            "Skipping non-numeric rating: 'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part I (M:I7) is another strong entry in the action/spy series, with Ethan (Cruise) looking slightly older, but not less determined to save the world. I believe the sequel to this film will be his last outing - but we'll see. This time, there's some Skynet-like sentient-AI that's manipulating nefarious types to take over the world, so the IMF team are out to get the two halves of key that can stop it.Isla (Ferguson), Benji (Pegg) and Luther (Rhames) are back, as well as CIA boss Kittridge (Czerny), with Grace (Atwell), a thief, being the newcomer. The bad guys that keep thwarting them are Gabriel (Morales) from Ethan's past, and Paris (Klementieff). The consistency of having McQuarrie as director of the two previous films helps, with everything feeling assured and this working as a really solid follow-up to 'Fallout'.There's some funny moments, some sincere ones, and some of Ethan running, as contractually-obliged. The whole final scene on the train is excellent, with so many things happening, but there's plenty of good set-pieces throughout, including a good car chase. However, the piece-de-resistance is the motorbike off the cliff into a BASE jump is something else. The fact Cruise did it for real, multiple times, is crazy and inspiring.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Man.... I wish I loved this movie more than I did. Don't get me wrong, it's a solid action movie with jaw-dropping stunts (some of the best in the series), but as a Mission: Impossible movie, it felt like a small step backward for the franchise. Fallout had mind-blowing action sequences and stunt work, along with developing Ethan's relationship with Ilsa, providing closure with Julia, showing the lengths Ethan would go to protect those closest to him, and battling an imposing villain. Dead Reckoning: Part One stretches the movie across two films only to seemingly showcase action spectacle after action spectacle while sacrificing character development. Characters I have grown to love over a decade of films felt sidelined, ignored, or wasted. Hayley Atwell's new character chewed up most of the screen time, and while she was fantastic, I wanted to see more of the original team. The new villain had an inconsistent ability that confused more than intimidated. There were some important emotional moments that I just didn't feel the weight of when I definitely should have. Part Two might tie everything together and make me enjoy Part One more in retrospect, but unfortunately, I left wanting more from this one.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Just got out of seeing this movie. I am really disappointed that they totally killed off the potential relationship between Ethan and Ilsa. I am totally OK with her dying but the way that they did it and how anti-climactic it was after building up her character so much in the previous two films. Just seems like she would've deserved a better death than that. Also, what was the point of showing the two characters getting closer to each other, and in the last film, his ex-wife, basically giving them permission to move forward when you're just going to kill her off like that. Honestly, Rebecca Ferguson revised this franchise two movies ago and I think killing off her character was a big mistake. Even in the scenes that she's in it doesn't even seem like she's playing the same person. I wonder if they wrote her out of the movie because she's too busy with the rest of her work. Hayley Atwell's character doesn't make sense to me either. Just put her in the IMF because she can pick some pockets? This all seems forced. Maybe most won't agree, but I think this development totally ruined the movie for me.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Just saw this one in a theatre, and boy... what an adrenaline rush it is. The latest Mission Impossible features some of the most incredible stunts ever put to camera. The story is absolutely exhilarating and continues to bring new life to a veteran movie franchise. The sheer scale of this movie is epic, and with every twist and turn of the movie, you cannot help but marvel at the incredible sets used to bring this movie to life. Such a movie begs to be seen on the biggest screen possible where you can truly feel the grandeur of the film. Tom Cruise has once again delivered one of the best movies of the year, and I cannot recommend that you see it enough!\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: To me, a new M:I film is an event. From Part 4 onwards, they've been spectacular (all 10/10's).There's some good stuff here for sure, and overall it's a solid 8, but it's simply not as good as previous entries.I kept noticing that a lot of scenes had just 2 or 3 people in them, and I kept imagining the crew all masked up, as well as the cast when the camera wasn't on them. It can't be easy to make a huge movie like this during a pandemic, but it definitely shows.The A. I. plot is quite good, and Hunt's as-yet-unknown backstory quite intriguing, but the whole story basically revolves around: \"I've got the key, now she's got the key, now he's got the key\" etc. So much pick-pocketing.Also, I really wish they hadn't ruined the motorcycle jump in the promos. If you've seen the promo, you've seen the scene. There are really only 3 or 4 action sequences, and nothing we haven't really seen before. I actually enjoyed the first desert shoot-out the best.And- oh!- the exposition! There's a scene near the beginning that reminded me of a Neil Breen(!) movie, where powerful people sit in a room and just spout buzz words like \"nuclear war,\" \"economic collapse,\" \"dogs and cats living together\" etc.THAT said, it's still an 8/10. Tom always gives it his best, the rest of the cast is good (especially all four female leads) and I thought the added humour with Hunt's character was a nice touch. I'd rather watch this ten times over than any blatant cyncial Disney cash-grab.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Good God. I feel ashamed for approaching this film with a modicum of doubt that Tom would still be able to deliver. Unbelievably, this epic actually manages to top the brilliant Fallout. Tom is literally going to die if he keeps doing these stunts. The motorbike sequence is utterly ludicrous. Intriguing plot with actual stakes and some familiar faces ably supported by brilliant new allies and villains. Sets up Part II perfectly with a sensational finale that homages Back to the Future 3, MI:1 and Speed. It is funny, action packed, polished and exhilarating. Harrison was great last week, but Tom is still the King. 9/10.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: I was lucky to be able to watch this 4 days before its official release in Czech Republic as a pre-premiere (didn't know such a thing existed) and it was the first time I've felt real excitement to go watch a film at the cinema in ages thanks to the recent genius combination of Fallout and Top Gun 2.I know what they were trying to do with this film. Bringing Kittridge back and a convoluted train finale all harked back to the 1st movie that sparked it all off. Explaining that convoluted storyline along the way harks back to the criticisms made about that same first film.The sky jump stunt was an attempt to beat the stunts from Tom Cruise in previous installments that have now become a beloved trademark of the franchise.But this film unfortunately overall is most reminiscent of the second installment which was Tom Cruise centric and lacked any real impossible mission requiring teamwork, real stakes and ingenious problem solving.In fact, it could have even been intentional that this film reminds the viewer of Mission Impossible 2. The photos in the film of past Ethan Hunt when searching for present Ethan Hunt show him with his longer hair as he looked in that second film.Ultimately, I expected the story to be way better than what we get in this instalment.There are 2 guys that keep appearing at each scene trying to catch Ethan which seems a very cheap simple story.And the very simple plot is explained in long scenes to make it seem way more complicated that it actually is (people complained there should be more explanation in the first film, but at least the plot in the first film actually required brain power), and I have to say that some of the acting is quite poor at times, not helped by some rather cheesy lines in the script, including the lines and accents in the opening Russian submarine sequence.There is also not that much action. 3 main action sequences for a close to 3 hour movie, which are the desert shoot out at the beginning, the Venice car chase, and the train crash at the end.I thought the alleyway fight scene, which some have praised, was really quite subpar and not very enthralling.The best action scene is the Venice car chase because it is genuinely funny (yes, because it is excellently laugh out loud funny, but not in any way tense); I never had the feeling that I was on the edge of my seat.The motorcycle sky jump scene was a major disappointment after the hype because if you didn't know Cruise actually did do that stunt, they used so much CGI that people would just assume it was computer generated. It actually reminded me of Pierce Brosnan's riding the tsunami in Die Another Day (sorry Tom! The stunt is still awesome!).The same for the train at the end. I know they actually made that train, and probably actually threw it off a bridge, but it doesn't look real. Though it is a long action finale and very fun to watch, for me the lack of realism takes away any tension. You are enjoying it for its visual value, but again not feeling any 'wow' factor or tension.At the end of Fallout, for example, you really felt Ethan Hunt was battered, bruised, worn out and still fighting to save humanity. There is none of that.The most tragic thing about this movie is that, unlike in the best of the previous films, we're back to the team being irrelevant in this one. Benji and Luther don't actually do very much.And poor Ilsa. Fallout ended with Ethan's ex-wife essentially giving him permission to move on and be with Ilsa.The relationship between Ilsa and Hunt had been built up over two excellent movies - Rogue Nation and Fallout - and in this film she says almost nothing, looks grumpy and sad all the time, and dies in an anticlimactic fight that is literally spelt out to the audience as a way to replace her with newcomer Grace.Grace, played by Hayley Atwell, is good. A likeable character and a capable actress, but I don't get the story unless Rebecca Ferguson said she wants out the franchise.The film is all about chasing \"the key.\" No twists. No high stakes. There is virtually no grittiness in this outing. It feels very light.Ultimately I was hoping to enjoy a quality film in the franchise. A movie like Oblivion, Edge of Tomorrow, Fallout, Top Gun 2 or American Made that you can show to anyone and say these are recent really high quality films starring this guy called Tom Cruise.This is not one of those films.It is more like The Mummy. It is better than Mission Impossible 2 but not better than any of the others in the franchise.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One confirms that Mission Impossible is the best franchise currently going and possibly ever made. A 2 hour 43 minute adrenaline rush that contains some of the best action sequences put to film, embarrasses the majority of the competition out there and sets the stage for a magnificent part 2 whilst still being a satisfying adventure in its own right.This is possibly the most open and obvious a Mission film has been with its deeper meaning for cinema and what aspect of Cruise's career is being dissected this time with a film that focuses on Ethan's relationship with women and basically outright declares AI to be a soulless monster and how the human element is always needed (perfect film to release during a writer's strike).Tom Cruise is perfect as Ethan Hunt and the strongest aspect this time round is when the film explores what made Ethan who he is and reminds you he genuinely cares about his team but that comes at a cost. Physically, the madman is still going strong with his stunts, driving a bike off a cliff in truly breathtaking fashion.Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg and Rebecca Ferguson remain the best IMF team and all play to their strengths here. The longer this series goes on the more authentic their growing friendship feels. Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis get more than expected and their buddy cop antics are a lot of fun.With Esai Morales' charismatic yet terrifying Gabriel and Pom Klementieff's terrific henchman of few words, this franchise finally has more good villains than bad. The return of Henry Czerny as Kittridge is glorious and he remains as gleefully despicable as his first appearance.The best new addition is easily Hayley Atwell. She plays a type of character never seen before in these films which makes her character and dynamic with Cruise fresh in comparison to everyone who's come before and their chemistry is magnetic. Instantaneous from the second they interact.Christopher McQuarrie's direction is phenomenal. The action sequences are suitably practical (this is how you spend $290 million), and the camera gets as close to the action as humanly possible, he remains one of the best in the business working at this scale. There's plenty of canted angles as a nice homage to De Palma's original and it helps give this one its own style in comparison to McQuarrie's previous entries.The pacing is really impressive with the film feeling like it's in a perpetual third act from its first airport heist (which is so much fun). Lorne Balfe does the music once again and yet again it's a highlight of the film, he knows how to elevate everything so well and really hammers home the emotional beats.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Ethan Hunt has left the mere secret agent status and has ascended to the all living perfect messiah.There is so much wrong with this movie, which seriously pains me because I seriously love this series. The mission impossible movies have steadily become more convoluted and more stupidly written. This film reaches the peak of absurdity, feeling more like an over the top fast and furious movie. All foolish action, cheap parlor tricks to pull the heart strings (empty relationships), horrible writing, poor plot development.I mean seriously what ever happened to show don't tell?! This is becoming rather ridiculous.*convoluted villain dialogue*\n",
            "\"So what you're telling me is you plan to establish a new world order if you get that key and if someone stops you that would be bad?!\"Has Ethan Hunt suddenly become this vanilla James Bond? With the Bond girl cycling through every few films? Lazy writing. Not natural feeling. Forced. BlighIt pains me to give this so low.The truth is, this movie is mindless entertaining action. Tom Cruise delivers on some awesome stunts (seldom compared to other MI films). It's not horrible. It's fun entertainment, but a scour on the (in my opinion) reputable authentic feeling mission impossible series.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: So you probably watched IM 6 and said, they can't make it any better can they? Or Top Gun 2, guess again, this is an adrenaline action movie with a good story, well written, action scenes that just blow you away, not a boring moment and you are on the edge of your seat all the time, this is how you make movies! Tom Cruise did it again, WOW!! It's an exhausting ride he takes you on, man I forgot to eat my popcorn and by the time i finally wanted some my wife had eaten all of it, but hey I was so immersed into the movie that time stood still and i forgot everything around me.Go and see it, this one gets my full recommendation, the only reason it's not a 10 is due to the fact it's not a completely new type of movie, however this one is done as a good action movie should be made, i don't see how they could have made it better, I really can't, go watch it and have a good time while you do it, it will put a big smile on your face that's for sure.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Am huge fan of MI franchise. The best part about all MI movies were how they plan and pull off an impossible mission. Thus I am quite disappointed on how this mission never seemed too difficult , let alone impossible.Action was okay. Car chase was funny, but not exciting. Jumping off the cliff seemed forced to me. Why would you keep driving uphill when you can take short cuts to reach the train. It wasn't even a fast train. The key kept being stolen from pockets too many times which makes you wonder how lazy the scripting was. Kill old gf to make new gf was also lazy writing.Unlike other MIs, Ethan had no single smart move or plan. It felt more like let's go and see what happens.Am not sure how MI fans ignored all these weaknesses and gave this film 8+ rating.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: This was a great movie. However, it lost a star from me for making the audience believe Ilsa is dead. They've spent two films building up Ilsa as being Ethan's equal, and hinted at an eventual romance. She's been able to fight off multiple men bare-handed yet she meets her demise by one guy when she has a sword? Then they brush past her death like it means nothing, only for her to be replaced by a new woman. I thought it was a huge disservice to the character.I know Rebecca Ferguson is very busy so she might have asked to leave, but I'm hoping this isn't the end for my favorite character in these films. She deserves a happy ending, or at least a better death than the one she received in this movie. It really took me out of the rest of the film. Hopefully, we'll see her again in Part Two.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Remember that classic MI scene where they broke in at CIA, and Cruise was hanging from the ceiling using wires? It's not a huge setpiece, but that scene is a nailbiting example of ingenious problem solving.In 'Dead Reckoning' there's none of that. Here it's keys changing hands every 10 minutes that is suppose to pass as suspense. And of course the only true selling point: the stunts performed by Tom Cruise.But I want and expect more than that.A large part of the film is devoted to people sitting or standing in a room, explaining what the plot is. Endless talking and explaining. We are told in several scenes the same information we just heard. Worst one is Benji, who is merely there to repeat things for someone in the cast, to make sure everyone in the audience knows what is going on. That is sloppy writing. One of the biggest no-no's as a screenwriter is resolving to \"so what you are saying is, that...\" info sharing. Benji does this all the time. And he is as incompetent as usual. And he is supposed to be a part of a small and unique team that is saving the world? Really?I hope MI:8 isn't just another Tom Cruise stunt reel where it looks like they make the story up as the go along, as long as all marks are checked in the end (running, face swapping, dealing with heights etc), and where character development takes a backseat. Bigger is not always better. And the action ALWAYS has to serve the story, not the other way around.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: After the first 30 minutes that promised an intellectual action thriller, the film starts its nosedive into mediocrity by introducing a thief who constantly indulges in disloyalty, for petty gains, towards the IMF and Hunt, but is held in high regards by Hunt. For the life of me, I couldn't understand why. The film also doesn't bother with it.Neither is it concerned with the so called action set pieces. _Fallout_ had plethora of those, one after the other, tied together by a cogent story line. For all its hype, it has 2-3 in a run time of close to 160 minutes, which tested my patience.Reading it's critics' reviews post viewing make me feel as if they have been written by the Entity, the AI behemoth at the center of this. The perceived entertainment value implied by them is not even remotely connected with the reality.It is no wonder that it is faltering at the US box office. It is no Top Gun- Maverick. Crowds are going to turn up, especially outside the US, because of Cruise's star power. But I don't believe this will please most of them.Disappointing.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: An absolute masterclass in producing an enjoyable action movie. Cinematography was great, the story was paced extremely well, and the casting of ALL roles was absolutely perfect.Cruise, Pegg and Rhames were awesome as always, Whigham and Davis were great additions, but the power quartet of Ferguson, Atwell, Klementieff and Kirby, really went above and beyond in making this movie perfect. Not to mention the chilling confidence of Morales as Gabriel, who practically oozes tangible danger.From the pre-opening credits scene to the final act, if you're like me, you will be on the edge of your seat - especially during any fight scene that involves Ferguson or Klementieff - and whilst there are moments that the tempo slows down to advance the story, it is always completely captivating.The single, solitary, disappointment comes as the credits roll, and you remember you're going to have to wait until next year to see how it ends.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Absolutely superb! Was hoping they could do the impossible and surpass Fallout! And Cruise, McQuarrie and co have accomplished this in spades, delivering the best spy/ action thriller in years.It is a next level masterclass of a film, with everything you would expect from an Mission Impossible film and more.The cast are great, with the new additions adding so much to the usual MI crew. The stunts are performed to the usual high standard and give you that Wow feeling you want, The story is fantastic, leaving you wanting more, setting up Part Two really wellGo see this on the best screen possible.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: It should be impossible to fumble the bag so badly on a nostalgia trip movie like this. Just let Tom Cruise run, do some crazy stunts and play the iconic theme music. But no they gotta drag on for three hours with a meaningless storyline just for it to be one part of an incomplete movie. Like whatever happened to movie editing? There's no reason for this movie to be this long and a lot of the content is completely unnecessary to move the plot forward. I don't expect MI movies to have watertight logic but then atleast the writers shouldn't twist themselves into knots thinking they're making a deeper movie than they are, the sooner these movie trends with AI, quantum space tunneling, multiverse nonsense end the better it is for good storylines.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: This latest Mission: Impossible movie is a slam dunk that needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible. Tom Cruise certainly knows how to make a movie. In another universe Cruse could have been Iron Man and I always felt that his aggression with the Mission: Impossible franchise was his way of making up for that. That's probably why the dialog in this movie felt like Ethan Hawk was captain America or something and they are going up against a Bonafede supervillain in the form of an A. I system. As far as I'm concern the best villain of the franchise snice the late and great Phillip Seymour Huffman.The Avengers Assemble as franchise regulars Simon Pegg as Dunn and Ving Rhimes, who I say with glee, started this franchise with Cruse as Luther, make their return as IMF agents. Rebecca Ferguson reprises her role from the last movie and Haley Atwell is in the movie as well, but none of this makes me as happy as Ving still being in the franchise.The action sequences are so good in this picture. It was worth having to stay in me seat for almost three hours just so they can add a little more action in-between the Hero's journey dialogue.And this is just part one!? Part two has some big shoes to fill!\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: I love Tom Cruise movies, but this one feels pretty contrived. Beyond the plot, Grace was the biggest detriment to the movie. The character started out amusing but her shtick became insufferable and Ethan's infatuation idiotic. How they handled Ilsa feels both rushed and cheap, with no emotional weight felt. The biggest stunt was spoiled beforehand which I suppose did its job in getting me in the seat, but totally ruins the moment in film. The final act also lacked any tension and was honestly a little boring - there wasn't any real cleverness.Still, it was humorous throughout, had a good amount of charm and the production value is evident. That's enough for me to be above average but it's unlikely I'll watch the followup in theater.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: As a hardout Mission fan. I can confirm 5 years was definitely worth the wait. The film is extremally charming and filled with exciting humor, action and story-telling. Tom and Hayley really bring the film so much joy and create wonderful chemistry. The chase scene in Rome puts you on the edge of your seat and nothing prepares you for the daring things Tom and Hayley pull off in the train sequence.. Tom really understands the action genre and did not disappoint with this film. There is a perfect blend between foundation building for the story and the action sequences. The film is a beautiful set up to the part 2 coming next year.. Brilliant Watch 100/10.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Straight up Dead Reckoning Part 1 was fine. I think it's the weakest out of the last four instalments.I can't put my finger on one exact thing but it just felt a little underdone compared to the last few M:I and was expecting big things the whole movie. It was a combination of things like the acting felt a little weak I guess, the script was just fine, the action was decent but not great compared to other M:I and to the likes of John Wick that I'm now used to. The plot with the A. I is nothing new but it's always still interesting and especially at a time in the real world where the advancements seem to be heating up but the whole pickpocketing the key for 2 hours also got boring so fast. Too many cliches started piling up. The hand to hand combat was some of the weakest stuff I've seen it a while especially the Venice bridge scene, it looked awful, like I could see the choreography. The best scene for me was the desert storm at the start which really had my attention but everything after that seemed just average.I don't know if everyone else is now completely over their only trick being having someone go as someone else with these masks. It's so boring to me now and at a stage I'm kinda rolling my eyes. I really hope the machine blowing a fuse means we have seen the last of them.Tom Cruise is awesome with the stunts he does and will always have respect for the things him doing them but I really wish they didn't show the motorbike cliff jump scene in the trailer. What you see in the trailer is literally the whole stunt, don't get me wrong it's truly impressive but they showed the whole thing and just completely killed it for me.I'm slightly bummed with this one and just coming off seeing Indian Jones and having a lot more fun watching that. I don't care about runtimes but you have to have me sucked in and the whole time, I felt the time...People will love this movie but M:I may have fizzled out with me a bit after this one.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Greetings again from the darkness. The challenge in continuing the \"Mission: Impossible\" franchise is that fans expect each entry to be \"bigger\" and more awe-inspiring than the last. With the seventh film in the series, and the third straight he has directed, writer-director Christopher McQuarrie and superstar actor and daredevil Tom Cruise have managed to accomplish what seemed unlikely ... they have delivered Ethan Hunt's biggest and grandest mission yet. Prepare to be awed by the action.You should know that this is \"Part One\" and it runs 163 minutes, a full hour longer than most movies, and exponentially more expensive to produce. All this during an age when ultra-high-budget blockbusters are being rumored to be fading from public interest. Of course, we are only one year removed from Tom Cruise's TOP GUN: MAVERICK being credited with 'saving cinema', so stay on alert for a 'sky is falling' panic. McQuarrie co-wrote the script with Erik Jendresen (\"Band of Brothers\"), and they remain faithful to the characters and storylines established by the TV series creator, Bruce Geller.There may never have been an actor more suited to a recurring role than Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt (Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones might be the closest). The story itself is fairly straightforward, even if the item being chased often feels like a MacGuffin. Your questioning of how a 'simple' spy-thriller can be effective is understandable, yet it's fascinating to watch as Ethan Hunt's mission in life as an agent is evaluated, as is the cost he's paid as a man. Providing a contemporary theme, the obscure object of desire is an all-powerful key (actually two parts of a key) based on controlling an all-encompassing Artificial Intelligence (AI).In a twist on a familiar theme (and a classic comedy film), we have Airports, Trains, and EVs, the latter being a tiny Fiat with handcuffs. Still, the car chase is everything we might hope, while the high-tech facial search in the airport sequence delivers the thrills for techie viewers, and the train sparring occurs inside as well as on top. And lest you be worried, there are enough Cruise sprint scenes here to put CHARIOTS OF FIRE to shame.Familiar faces include Ethan Hunt's team of Luther (Ving Rhames, who along with Cruise, has appeared in all 7 MI films), Benji (Simon Pegg), and Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). It's nice to again see (and hear) Henry Czerny as Kittridge, Vanessa Kirby as arms dealer The White Widow, and Esai Morales - as Gabriel, the required villain in search of the same key as our good guys. New faces include Haylee Atwell as master pickpocket Grace, whose soul may or may not be beyond salvation; Cary Elwes as agency director Denlinger; Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis as officers after rogue Hunt; and Pom Klementieff as a hired assassin.The stunt work here is outstanding, and of course, Tom Cruise is renowned for personally handling many of the most breathtaking acts - the most memorable one here being his riding of a motorcycle off a cliff. This stunt has a 'making of' video that's been available for a while. As movie goers, we've never seen anything like it. This part one was originally scheduled for release in 2021 (thanks a lot, COVID), and now Part Two is set for 2024. It's been 27 years since the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE (1996) with Jon Voight ... Cruise was 34 in that one. This particular mission is the biggest yet, and it would certainly be impossible for the rest of us. It's a mission that will be closed out in Part Two, and simultaneously bring an end to Cruise's remarkable run as Ethan Hunt.Opening July 12, 2023.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: This movie started out promising but by the end, it just felt like being robbed of two and a half hours. I am a big fan of the MI movies (including MI2, which people seem to hate) and I could appreciate this movie for the few scenes that it did right, but it treats the audience like idiots in its bland, repetitive storyline (how many times do we need to hear the words \"the key\" and \"the entity\"? It was as if the writers of this movie just gave up on their jobs when they wrote this. Easily the weakest MI movie ever filmed. It had me staring at my watch every 20 minutes. As others have mentioned, the character development in this movie is also truly awful. I have barely any interest in seeing Part Two of Dead Reckoning at this point. The high scores this movie is getting absolutely baffle me. This movie by no means deserves a score higher than a 6 or a 6.5.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Basically, this movie is big, loud, and stupid.Definitely TOO loud, in fact. The music attempts to turn even the most minor scene into some sort of heart-pounding climax.There are endless ridiculous fights in which Tom Cruise is predictably unstoppable, no matter how many opponents he's up against. Slim girls get to beat up multiple men. (Emily Blunt was right when, commenting on a fight in \"Sicario\" in which, refreshingly, she loses to a bigger guy, she noted that Hollywood fight scenes in which 110-pound women whip larger males are \"so cheesy.\")The dull, tepid, way-too-pretty villain is, implausibly, a formidable fighter but sure doesn't look like one. An action movie is only as good as its villain is evil; this guy looks like a French fashion mogul.He and Cruise fight on top of -- wait for it -- a moving train! Haven't we seen that ridiculous sort of thing a hundred times before?The tediously overcomplicated plot makes it hard to keep track of who's on which side, nor do we care. Apparently, as is usual these days, we're supposed to root against the U. S. government.In all scenes involving conversations, virtually EVERY line is merely plot exposition in which characters tell us, in stilted dialogue, what's going on, what's supposed to happen, and how we're supposed to feel.The much-touted parachute jump is actually disappointing. It's over quite fast, and its main source of interest is that, if you've seen the promotional video, you know that Cruise himself actually made that jump.The only truly enjoyable sequence -- the cleverly worked-out rescue attempts on the falling train -- comes at the end, after nearly two and a half hours of empty cartoonish nonsense...Including, of course, an overlong cartoonish car chase, obligatory in dumb summer movies.\n",

It feels huge the whole time however I must say I while the set pieces were stellar, the hand to hand combat scenes were not great and a big step down from the last film (Fallout).Thebeginning is slow with a lot of expository being dumped (more than you'd usually see) but once it gets going it is pretty nonstop.This is a good chapter and Haley Atwell shines but it is nowhere near my favorite of the series.7/10Mi rankingsMi6 Fallout\n",

            "Skipping non-numeric rating: 'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part I (M:I7) is another strong entry in the action/spy series, with Ethan (Cruise) looking slightly older, but not less determined to save the world. I believe the sequel to this film will be his last outing - but we'll see. This time, there's some Skynet-like sentient-AI that's manipulating nefarious types to take over the world, so the IMF team are out to get the two halves of key that can stop it.Isla (Ferguson), Benji (Pegg) and Luther (Rhames) are back, as well as CIA boss Kittridge (Czerny), with Grace (Atwell), a thief, being the newcomer. The bad guys that keep thwarting them are Gabriel (Morales) from Ethan's past, and Paris (Klementieff). The consistency of having McQuarrie as director of the two previous films helps, with everything feeling assured and this working as a really solid follow-up to 'Fallout'.There's some funny moments, some sincere ones, and some of Ethan running, as contractually-obliged. The whole final scene on the train is excellent, with so many things happening, but there's plenty of good set-pieces throughout, including a good car chase. However, the piece-de-resistance is the motorbike off the cliff into a BASE jump is something else. The fact Cruise did it for real, multiple times, is crazy and inspiring.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Man.... I wish I loved this movie more than I did. Don't get me wrong, it's a solid action movie with jaw-dropping stunts (some of the best in the series), but as a Mission: Impossible movie, it felt like a small step backward for the franchise. Fallout had mind-blowing action sequences and stunt work, along with developing Ethan's relationship with Ilsa, providing closure with Julia, showing the lengths Ethan would go to protect those closest to him, and battling an imposing villain. Dead Reckoning: Part One stretches the movie across two films only to seemingly showcase action spectacle after action spectacle while sacrificing character development. Characters I have grown to love over a decade of films felt sidelined, ignored, or wasted. Hayley Atwell's new character chewed up most of the screen time, and while she was fantastic, I wanted to see more of the original team. The new villain had an inconsistent ability that confused more than intimidated. There were some important emotional moments that I just didn't feel the weight of when I definitely should have. Part Two might tie everything together and make me enjoy Part One more in retrospect, but unfortunately, I left wanting more from this one.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Just got out of seeing this movie. I am really disappointed that they totally killed off the potential relationship between Ethan and Ilsa. I am totally OK with her dying but the way that they did it and how anti-climactic it was after building up her character so much in the previous two films. Just seems like she would've deserved a better death than that. Also, what was the point of showing the two characters getting closer to each other, and in the last film, his ex-wife, basically giving them permission to move forward when you're just going to kill her off like that. Honestly, Rebecca Ferguson revised this franchise two movies ago and I think killing off her character was a big mistake. Even in the scenes that she's in it doesn't even seem like she's playing the same person. I wonder if they wrote her out of the movie because she's too busy with the rest of her work. Hayley Atwell's character doesn't make sense to me either. Just put her in the IMF because she can pick some pockets? This all seems forced. Maybe most won't agree, but I think this development totally ruined the movie for me.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Just saw this one in a theatre, and boy... what an adrenaline rush it is. The latest Mission Impossible features some of the most incredible stunts ever put to camera. The story is absolutely exhilarating and continues to bring new life to a veteran movie franchise. The sheer scale of this movie is epic, and with every twist and turn of the movie, you cannot help but marvel at the incredible sets used to bring this movie to life. Such a movie begs to be seen on the biggest screen possible where you can truly feel the grandeur of the film. Tom Cruise has once again delivered one of the best movies of the year, and I cannot recommend that you see it enough!\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: To me, a new M:I film is an event. From Part 4 onwards, they've been spectacular (all 10/10's).There's some good stuff here for sure, and overall it's a solid 8, but it's simply not as good as previous entries.I kept noticing that a lot of scenes had just 2 or 3 people in them, and I kept imagining the crew all masked up, as well as the cast when the camera wasn't on them. It can't be easy to make a huge movie like this during a pandemic, but it definitely shows.The A. I. plot is quite good, and Hunt's as-yet-unknown backstory quite intriguing, but the whole story basically revolves around: \"I've got the key, now she's got the key, now he's got the key\" etc. So much pick-pocketing.Also, I really wish they hadn't ruined the motorcycle jump in the promos. If you've seen the promo, you've seen the scene. There are really only 3 or 4 action sequences, and nothing we haven't really seen before. I actually enjoyed the first desert shoot-out the best.And- oh!- the exposition! There's a scene near the beginning that reminded me of a Neil Breen(!) movie, where powerful people sit in a room and just spout buzz words like \"nuclear war,\" \"economic collapse,\" \"dogs and cats living together\" etc.THAT said, it's still an 8/10. Tom always gives it his best, the rest of the cast is good (especially all four female leads) and I thought the added humour with Hunt's character was a nice touch. I'd rather watch this ten times over than any blatant cyncial Disney cash-grab.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Good God. I feel ashamed for approaching this film with a modicum of doubt that Tom would still be able to deliver. Unbelievably, this epic actually manages to top the brilliant Fallout. Tom is literally going to die if he keeps doing these stunts. The motorbike sequence is utterly ludicrous. Intriguing plot with actual stakes and some familiar faces ably supported by brilliant new allies and villains. Sets up Part II perfectly with a sensational finale that homages Back to the Future 3, MI:1 and Speed. It is funny, action packed, polished and exhilarating. Harrison was great last week, but Tom is still the King. 9/10.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: I was lucky to be able to watch this 4 days before its official release in Czech Republic as a pre-premiere (didn't know such a thing existed) and it was the first time I've felt real excitement to go watch a film at the cinema in ages thanks to the recent genius combination of Fallout and Top Gun 2.I know what they were trying to do with this film. Bringing Kittridge back and a convoluted train finale all harked back to the 1st movie that sparked it all off. Explaining that convoluted storyline along the way harks back to the criticisms made about that same first film.The sky jump stunt was an attempt to beat the stunts from Tom Cruise in previous installments that have now become a beloved trademark of the franchise.But this film unfortunately overall is most reminiscent of the second installment which was Tom Cruise centric and lacked any real impossible mission requiring teamwork, real stakes and ingenious problem solving.In fact, it could have even been intentional that this film reminds the viewer of Mission Impossible 2. The photos in the film of past Ethan Hunt when searching for present Ethan Hunt show him with his longer hair as he looked in that second film.Ultimately, I expected the story to be way better than what we get in this instalment.There are 2 guys that keep appearing at each scene trying to catch Ethan which seems a very cheap simple story.And the very simple plot is explained in long scenes to make it seem way more complicated that it actually is (people complained there should be more explanation in the first film, but at least the plot in the first film actually required brain power), and I have to say that some of the acting is quite poor at times, not helped by some rather cheesy lines in the script, including the lines and accents in the opening Russian submarine sequence.There is also not that much action. 3 main action sequences for a close to 3 hour movie, which are the desert shoot out at the beginning, the Venice car chase, and the train crash at the end.I thought the alleyway fight scene, which some have praised, was really quite subpar and not very enthralling.The best action scene is the Venice car chase because it is genuinely funny (yes, because it is excellently laugh out loud funny, but not in any way tense); I never had the feeling that I was on the edge of my seat.The motorcycle sky jump scene was a major disappointment after the hype because if you didn't know Cruise actually did do that stunt, they used so much CGI that people would just assume it was computer generated. It actually reminded me of Pierce Brosnan's riding the tsunami in Die Another Day (sorry Tom! The stunt is still awesome!).The same for the train at the end. I know they actually made that train, and probably actually threw it off a bridge, but it doesn't look real. Though it is a long action finale and very fun to watch, for me the lack of realism takes away any tension. You are enjoying it for its visual value, but again not feeling any 'wow' factor or tension.At the end of Fallout, for example, you really felt Ethan Hunt was battered, bruised, worn out and still fighting to save humanity. There is none of that.The most tragic thing about this movie is that, unlike in the best of the previous films, we're back to the team being irrelevant in this one. Benji and Luther don't actually do very much.And poor Ilsa. Fallout ended with Ethan's ex-wife essentially giving him permission to move on and be with Ilsa.The relationship between Ilsa and Hunt had been built up over two excellent movies - Rogue Nation and Fallout - and in this film she says almost nothing, looks grumpy and sad all the time, and dies in an anticlimactic fight that is literally spelt out to the audience as a way to replace her with newcomer Grace.Grace, played by Hayley Atwell, is good. A likeable character and a capable actress, but I don't get the story unless Rebecca Ferguson said she wants out the franchise.The film is all about chasing \"the key.\" No twists. No high stakes. There is virtually no grittiness in this outing. It feels very light.Ultimately I was hoping to enjoy a quality film in the franchise. A movie like Oblivion, Edge of Tomorrow, Fallout, Top Gun 2 or American Made that you can show to anyone and say these are recent really high quality films starring this guy called Tom Cruise.This is not one of those films.It is more like The Mummy. It is better than Mission Impossible 2 but not better than any of the others in the franchise.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One confirms that Mission Impossible is the best franchise currently going and possibly ever made. A 2 hour 43 minute adrenaline rush that contains some of the best action sequences put to film, embarrasses the majority of the competition out there and sets the stage for a magnificent part 2 whilst still being a satisfying adventure in its own right.This is possibly the most open and obvious a Mission film has been with its deeper meaning for cinema and what aspect of Cruise's career is being dissected this time with a film that focuses on Ethan's relationship with women and basically outright declares AI to be a soulless monster and how the human element is always needed (perfect film to release during a writer's strike).Tom Cruise is perfect as Ethan Hunt and the strongest aspect this time round is when the film explores what made Ethan who he is and reminds you he genuinely cares about his team but that comes at a cost. Physically, the madman is still going strong with his stunts, driving a bike off a cliff in truly breathtaking fashion.Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg and Rebecca Ferguson remain the best IMF team and all play to their strengths here. The longer this series goes on the more authentic their growing friendship feels. Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis get more than expected and their buddy cop antics are a lot of fun.With Esai Morales' charismatic yet terrifying Gabriel and Pom Klementieff's terrific henchman of few words, this franchise finally has more good villains than bad. The return of Henry Czerny as Kittridge is glorious and he remains as gleefully despicable as his first appearance.The best new addition is easily Hayley Atwell. She plays a type of character never seen before in these films which makes her character and dynamic with Cruise fresh in comparison to everyone who's come before and their chemistry is magnetic. Instantaneous from the second they interact.Christopher McQuarrie's direction is phenomenal. The action sequences are suitably practical (this is how you spend $290 million), and the camera gets as close to the action as humanly possible, he remains one of the best in the business working at this scale. There's plenty of canted angles as a nice homage to De Palma's original and it helps give this one its own style in comparison to McQuarrie's previous entries.The pacing is really impressive with the film feeling like it's in a perpetual third act from its first airport heist (which is so much fun). Lorne Balfe does the music once again and yet again it's a highlight of the film, he knows how to elevate everything so well and really hammers home the emotional beats.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Ethan Hunt has left the mere secret agent status and has ascended to the all living perfect messiah.There is so much wrong with this movie, which seriously pains me because I seriously love this series. The mission impossible movies have steadily become more convoluted and more stupidly written. This film reaches the peak of absurdity, feeling more like an over the top fast and furious movie. All foolish action, cheap parlor tricks to pull the heart strings (empty relationships), horrible writing, poor plot development.I mean seriously what ever happened to show don't tell?! This is becoming rather ridiculous.*convoluted villain dialogue*\n",
            "\"So what you're telling me is you plan to establish a new world order if you get that key and if someone stops you that would be bad?!\"Has Ethan Hunt suddenly become this vanilla James Bond? With the Bond girl cycling through every few films? Lazy writing. Not natural feeling. Forced. BlighIt pains me to give this so low.The truth is, this movie is mindless entertaining action. Tom Cruise delivers on some awesome stunts (seldom compared to other MI films). It's not horrible. It's fun entertainment, but a scour on the (in my opinion) reputable authentic feeling mission impossible series.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: So you probably watched IM 6 and said, they can't make it any better can they? Or Top Gun 2, guess again, this is an adrenaline action movie with a good story, well written, action scenes that just blow you away, not a boring moment and you are on the edge of your seat all the time, this is how you make movies! Tom Cruise did it again, WOW!! It's an exhausting ride he takes you on, man I forgot to eat my popcorn and by the time i finally wanted some my wife had eaten all of it, but hey I was so immersed into the movie that time stood still and i forgot everything around me.Go and see it, this one gets my full recommendation, the only reason it's not a 10 is due to the fact it's not a completely new type of movie, however this one is done as a good action movie should be made, i don't see how they could have made it better, I really can't, go watch it and have a good time while you do it, it will put a big smile on your face that's for sure.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Am huge fan of MI franchise. The best part about all MI movies were how they plan and pull off an impossible mission. Thus I am quite disappointed on how this mission never seemed too difficult , let alone impossible.Action was okay. Car chase was funny, but not exciting. Jumping off the cliff seemed forced to me. Why would you keep driving uphill when you can take short cuts to reach the train. It wasn't even a fast train. The key kept being stolen from pockets too many times which makes you wonder how lazy the scripting was. Kill old gf to make new gf was also lazy writing.Unlike other MIs, Ethan had no single smart move or plan. It felt more like let's go and see what happens.Am not sure how MI fans ignored all these weaknesses and gave this film 8+ rating.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: This was a great movie. However, it lost a star from me for making the audience believe Ilsa is dead. They've spent two films building up Ilsa as being Ethan's equal, and hinted at an eventual romance. She's been able to fight off multiple men bare-handed yet she meets her demise by one guy when she has a sword? Then they brush past her death like it means nothing, only for her to be replaced by a new woman. I thought it was a huge disservice to the character.I know Rebecca Ferguson is very busy so she might have asked to leave, but I'm hoping this isn't the end for my favorite character in these films. She deserves a happy ending, or at least a better death than the one she received in this movie. It really took me out of the rest of the film. Hopefully, we'll see her again in Part Two.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Remember that classic MI scene where they broke in at CIA, and Cruise was hanging from the ceiling using wires? It's not a huge setpiece, but that scene is a nailbiting example of ingenious problem solving.In 'Dead Reckoning' there's none of that. Here it's keys changing hands every 10 minutes that is suppose to pass as suspense. And of course the only true selling point: the stunts performed by Tom Cruise.But I want and expect more than that.A large part of the film is devoted to people sitting or standing in a room, explaining what the plot is. Endless talking and explaining. We are told in several scenes the same information we just heard. Worst one is Benji, who is merely there to repeat things for someone in the cast, to make sure everyone in the audience knows what is going on. That is sloppy writing. One of the biggest no-no's as a screenwriter is resolving to \"so what you are saying is, that...\" info sharing. Benji does this all the time. And he is as incompetent as usual. And he is supposed to be a part of a small and unique team that is saving the world? Really?I hope MI:8 isn't just another Tom Cruise stunt reel where it looks like they make the story up as the go along, as long as all marks are checked in the end (running, face swapping, dealing with heights etc), and where character development takes a backseat. Bigger is not always better. And the action ALWAYS has to serve the story, not the other way around.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: After the first 30 minutes that promised an intellectual action thriller, the film starts its nosedive into mediocrity by introducing a thief who constantly indulges in disloyalty, for petty gains, towards the IMF and Hunt, but is held in high regards by Hunt. For the life of me, I couldn't understand why. The film also doesn't bother with it.Neither is it concerned with the so called action set pieces. _Fallout_ had plethora of those, one after the other, tied together by a cogent story line. For all its hype, it has 2-3 in a run time of close to 160 minutes, which tested my patience.Reading it's critics' reviews post viewing make me feel as if they have been written by the Entity, the AI behemoth at the center of this. The perceived entertainment value implied by them is not even remotely connected with the reality.It is no wonder that it is faltering at the US box office. It is no Top Gun- Maverick. Crowds are going to turn up, especially outside the US, because of Cruise's star power. But I don't believe this will please most of them.Disappointing.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: An absolute masterclass in producing an enjoyable action movie. Cinematography was great, the story was paced extremely well, and the casting of ALL roles was absolutely perfect.Cruise, Pegg and Rhames were awesome as always, Whigham and Davis were great additions, but the power quartet of Ferguson, Atwell, Klementieff and Kirby, really went above and beyond in making this movie perfect. Not to mention the chilling confidence of Morales as Gabriel, who practically oozes tangible danger.From the pre-opening credits scene to the final act, if you're like me, you will be on the edge of your seat - especially during any fight scene that involves Ferguson or Klementieff - and whilst there are moments that the tempo slows down to advance the story, it is always completely captivating.The single, solitary, disappointment comes as the credits roll, and you remember you're going to have to wait until next year to see how it ends.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Absolutely superb! Was hoping they could do the impossible and surpass Fallout! And Cruise, McQuarrie and co have accomplished this in spades, delivering the best spy/ action thriller in years.It is a next level masterclass of a film, with everything you would expect from an Mission Impossible film and more.The cast are great, with the new additions adding so much to the usual MI crew. The stunts are performed to the usual high standard and give you that Wow feeling you want, The story is fantastic, leaving you wanting more, setting up Part Two really wellGo see this on the best screen possible.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: It should be impossible to fumble the bag so badly on a nostalgia trip movie like this. Just let Tom Cruise run, do some crazy stunts and play the iconic theme music. But no they gotta drag on for three hours with a meaningless storyline just for it to be one part of an incomplete movie. Like whatever happened to movie editing? There's no reason for this movie to be this long and a lot of the content is completely unnecessary to move the plot forward. I don't expect MI movies to have watertight logic but then atleast the writers shouldn't twist themselves into knots thinking they're making a deeper movie than they are, the sooner these movie trends with AI, quantum space tunneling, multiverse nonsense end the better it is for good storylines.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: This latest Mission: Impossible movie is a slam dunk that needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible. Tom Cruise certainly knows how to make a movie. In another universe Cruse could have been Iron Man and I always felt that his aggression with the Mission: Impossible franchise was his way of making up for that. That's probably why the dialog in this movie felt like Ethan Hawk was captain America or something and they are going up against a Bonafede supervillain in the form of an A. I system. As far as I'm concern the best villain of the franchise snice the late and great Phillip Seymour Huffman.The Avengers Assemble as franchise regulars Simon Pegg as Dunn and Ving Rhimes, who I say with glee, started this franchise with Cruse as Luther, make their return as IMF agents. Rebecca Ferguson reprises her role from the last movie and Haley Atwell is in the movie as well, but none of this makes me as happy as Ving still being in the franchise.The action sequences are so good in this picture. It was worth having to stay in me seat for almost three hours just so they can add a little more action in-between the Hero's journey dialogue.And this is just part one!? Part two has some big shoes to fill!\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: I love Tom Cruise movies, but this one feels pretty contrived. Beyond the plot, Grace was the biggest detriment to the movie. The character started out amusing but her shtick became insufferable and Ethan's infatuation idiotic. How they handled Ilsa feels both rushed and cheap, with no emotional weight felt. The biggest stunt was spoiled beforehand which I suppose did its job in getting me in the seat, but totally ruins the moment in film. The final act also lacked any tension and was honestly a little boring - there wasn't any real cleverness.Still, it was humorous throughout, had a good amount of charm and the production value is evident. That's enough for me to be above average but it's unlikely I'll watch the followup in theater.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: As a hardout Mission fan. I can confirm 5 years was definitely worth the wait. The film is extremally charming and filled with exciting humor, action and story-telling. Tom and Hayley really bring the film so much joy and create wonderful chemistry. The chase scene in Rome puts you on the edge of your seat and nothing prepares you for the daring things Tom and Hayley pull off in the train sequence.. Tom really understands the action genre and did not disappoint with this film. There is a perfect blend between foundation building for the story and the action sequences. The film is a beautiful set up to the part 2 coming next year.. Brilliant Watch 100/10.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Straight up Dead Reckoning Part 1 was fine. I think it's the weakest out of the last four instalments.I can't put my finger on one exact thing but it just felt a little underdone compared to the last few M:I and was expecting big things the whole movie. It was a combination of things like the acting felt a little weak I guess, the script was just fine, the action was decent but not great compared to other M:I and to the likes of John Wick that I'm now used to. The plot with the A. I is nothing new but it's always still interesting and especially at a time in the real world where the advancements seem to be heating up but the whole pickpocketing the key for 2 hours also got boring so fast. Too many cliches started piling up. The hand to hand combat was some of the weakest stuff I've seen it a while especially the Venice bridge scene, it looked awful, like I could see the choreography. The best scene for me was the desert storm at the start which really had my attention but everything after that seemed just average.I don't know if everyone else is now completely over their only trick being having someone go as someone else with these masks. It's so boring to me now and at a stage I'm kinda rolling my eyes. I really hope the machine blowing a fuse means we have seen the last of them.Tom Cruise is awesome with the stunts he does and will always have respect for the things him doing them but I really wish they didn't show the motorbike cliff jump scene in the trailer. What you see in the trailer is literally the whole stunt, don't get me wrong it's truly impressive but they showed the whole thing and just completely killed it for me.I'm slightly bummed with this one and just coming off seeing Indian Jones and having a lot more fun watching that. I don't care about runtimes but you have to have me sucked in and the whole time, I felt the time...People will love this movie but M:I may have fizzled out with me a bit after this one.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Greetings again from the darkness. The challenge in continuing the \"Mission: Impossible\" franchise is that fans expect each entry to be \"bigger\" and more awe-inspiring than the last. With the seventh film in the series, and the third straight he has directed, writer-director Christopher McQuarrie and superstar actor and daredevil Tom Cruise have managed to accomplish what seemed unlikely ... they have delivered Ethan Hunt's biggest and grandest mission yet. Prepare to be awed by the action.You should know that this is \"Part One\" and it runs 163 minutes, a full hour longer than most movies, and exponentially more expensive to produce. All this during an age when ultra-high-budget blockbusters are being rumored to be fading from public interest. Of course, we are only one year removed from Tom Cruise's TOP GUN: MAVERICK being credited with 'saving cinema', so stay on alert for a 'sky is falling' panic. McQuarrie co-wrote the script with Erik Jendresen (\"Band of Brothers\"), and they remain faithful to the characters and storylines established by the TV series creator, Bruce Geller.There may never have been an actor more suited to a recurring role than Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt (Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones might be the closest). The story itself is fairly straightforward, even if the item being chased often feels like a MacGuffin. Your questioning of how a 'simple' spy-thriller can be effective is understandable, yet it's fascinating to watch as Ethan Hunt's mission in life as an agent is evaluated, as is the cost he's paid as a man. Providing a contemporary theme, the obscure object of desire is an all-powerful key (actually two parts of a key) based on controlling an all-encompassing Artificial Intelligence (AI).In a twist on a familiar theme (and a classic comedy film), we have Airports, Trains, and EVs, the latter being a tiny Fiat with handcuffs. Still, the car chase is everything we might hope, while the high-tech facial search in the airport sequence delivers the thrills for techie viewers, and the train sparring occurs inside as well as on top. And lest you be worried, there are enough Cruise sprint scenes here to put CHARIOTS OF FIRE to shame.Familiar faces include Ethan Hunt's team of Luther (Ving Rhames, who along with Cruise, has appeared in all 7 MI films), Benji (Simon Pegg), and Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). It's nice to again see (and hear) Henry Czerny as Kittridge, Vanessa Kirby as arms dealer The White Widow, and Esai Morales - as Gabriel, the required villain in search of the same key as our good guys. New faces include Haylee Atwell as master pickpocket Grace, whose soul may or may not be beyond salvation; Cary Elwes as agency director Denlinger; Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis as officers after rogue Hunt; and Pom Klementieff as a hired assassin.The stunt work here is outstanding, and of course, Tom Cruise is renowned for personally handling many of the most breathtaking acts - the most memorable one here being his riding of a motorcycle off a cliff. This stunt has a 'making of' video that's been available for a while. As movie goers, we've never seen anything like it. This part one was originally scheduled for release in 2021 (thanks a lot, COVID), and now Part Two is set for 2024. It's been 27 years since the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE (1996) with Jon Voight ... Cruise was 34 in that one. This particular mission is the biggest yet, and it would certainly be impossible for the rest of us. It's a mission that will be closed out in Part Two, and simultaneously bring an end to Cruise's remarkable run as Ethan Hunt.Opening July 12, 2023.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: This movie started out promising but by the end, it just felt like being robbed of two and a half hours. I am a big fan of the MI movies (including MI2, which people seem to hate) and I could appreciate this movie for the few scenes that it did right, but it treats the audience like idiots in its bland, repetitive storyline (how many times do we need to hear the words \"the key\" and \"the entity\"? It was as if the writers of this movie just gave up on their jobs when they wrote this. Easily the weakest MI movie ever filmed. It had me staring at my watch every 20 minutes. As others have mentioned, the character development in this movie is also truly awful. I have barely any interest in seeing Part Two of Dead Reckoning at this point. The high scores this movie is getting absolutely baffle me. This movie by no means deserves a score higher than a 6 or a 6.5.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Basically, this movie is big, loud, and stupid.Definitely TOO loud, in fact. The music attempts to turn even the most minor scene into some sort of heart-pounding climax.There are endless ridiculous fights in which Tom Cruise is predictably unstoppable, no matter how many opponents he's up against. Slim girls get to beat up multiple men. (Emily Blunt was right when, commenting on a fight in \"Sicario\" in which, refreshingly, she loses to a bigger guy, she noted that Hollywood fight scenes in which 110-pound women whip larger males are \"so cheesy.\")The dull, tepid, way-too-pretty villain is, implausibly, a formidable fighter but sure doesn't look like one. An action movie is only as good as its villain is evil; this guy looks like a French fashion mogul.He and Cruise fight on top of -- wait for it -- a moving train! Haven't we seen that ridiculous sort of thing a hundred times before?The tediously overcomplicated plot makes it hard to keep track of who's on which side, nor do we care. Apparently, as is usual these days, we're supposed to root against the U. S. government.In all scenes involving conversations, virtually EVERY line is merely plot exposition in which characters tell us, in stilted dialogue, what's going on, what's supposed to happen, and how we're supposed to feel.The much-touted parachute jump is actually disappointing. It's over quite fast, and its main source of interest is that, if you've seen the promotional video, you know that Cruise himself actually made that jump.The only truly enjoyable sequence -- the cleverly worked-out rescue attempts on the falling train -- comes at the end, after nearly two and a half hours of empty cartoonish nonsense...Including, of course, an overlong cartoonish car chase, obligatory in dumb summer movies.\n",

It feels huge the whole time however I must say I while the set pieces were stellar, the hand to hand combat scenes were not great and a big step down from the last film (Fallout).Thebeginning is slow with a lot of expository being dumped (more than you'd usually see) but once it gets going it is pretty nonstop.This is a good chapter and Haley Atwell shines but it is nowhere near my favorite of the series.7/10Mi rankingsMi6 Fallout\n",

            "Skipping non-numeric rating: 'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part I (M:I7) is another strong entry in the action/spy series, with Ethan (Cruise) looking slightly older, but not less determined to save the world. I believe the sequel to this film will be his last outing - but we'll see. This time, there's some Skynet-like sentient-AI that's manipulating nefarious types to take over the world, so the IMF team are out to get the two halves of key that can stop it.Isla (Ferguson), Benji (Pegg) and Luther (Rhames) are back, as well as CIA boss Kittridge (Czerny), with Grace (Atwell), a thief, being the newcomer. The bad guys that keep thwarting them are Gabriel (Morales) from Ethan's past, and Paris (Klementieff). The consistency of having McQuarrie as director of the two previous films helps, with everything feeling assured and this working as a really solid follow-up to 'Fallout'.There's some funny moments, some sincere ones, and some of Ethan running, as contractually-obliged. The whole final scene on the train is excellent, with so many things happening, but there's plenty of good set-pieces throughout, including a good car chase. However, the piece-de-resistance is the motorbike off the cliff into a BASE jump is something else. The fact Cruise did it for real, multiple times, is crazy and inspiring.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Man.... I wish I loved this movie more than I did. Don't get me wrong, it's a solid action movie with jaw-dropping stunts (some of the best in the series), but as a Mission: Impossible movie, it felt like a small step backward for the franchise. Fallout had mind-blowing action sequences and stunt work, along with developing Ethan's relationship with Ilsa, providing closure with Julia, showing the lengths Ethan would go to protect those closest to him, and battling an imposing villain. Dead Reckoning: Part One stretches the movie across two films only to seemingly showcase action spectacle after action spectacle while sacrificing character development. Characters I have grown to love over a decade of films felt sidelined, ignored, or wasted. Hayley Atwell's new character chewed up most of the screen time, and while she was fantastic, I wanted to see more of the original team. The new villain had an inconsistent ability that confused more than intimidated. There were some important emotional moments that I just didn't feel the weight of when I definitely should have. Part Two might tie everything together and make me enjoy Part One more in retrospect, but unfortunately, I left wanting more from this one.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Just got out of seeing this movie. I am really disappointed that they totally killed off the potential relationship between Ethan and Ilsa. I am totally OK with her dying but the way that they did it and how anti-climactic it was after building up her character so much in the previous two films. Just seems like she would've deserved a better death than that. Also, what was the point of showing the two characters getting closer to each other, and in the last film, his ex-wife, basically giving them permission to move forward when you're just going to kill her off like that. Honestly, Rebecca Ferguson revised this franchise two movies ago and I think killing off her character was a big mistake. Even in the scenes that she's in it doesn't even seem like she's playing the same person. I wonder if they wrote her out of the movie because she's too busy with the rest of her work. Hayley Atwell's character doesn't make sense to me either. Just put her in the IMF because she can pick some pockets? This all seems forced. Maybe most won't agree, but I think this development totally ruined the movie for me.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Just saw this one in a theatre, and boy... what an adrenaline rush it is. The latest Mission Impossible features some of the most incredible stunts ever put to camera. The story is absolutely exhilarating and continues to bring new life to a veteran movie franchise. The sheer scale of this movie is epic, and with every twist and turn of the movie, you cannot help but marvel at the incredible sets used to bring this movie to life. Such a movie begs to be seen on the biggest screen possible where you can truly feel the grandeur of the film. Tom Cruise has once again delivered one of the best movies of the year, and I cannot recommend that you see it enough!\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: To me, a new M:I film is an event. From Part 4 onwards, they've been spectacular (all 10/10's).There's some good stuff here for sure, and overall it's a solid 8, but it's simply not as good as previous entries.I kept noticing that a lot of scenes had just 2 or 3 people in them, and I kept imagining the crew all masked up, as well as the cast when the camera wasn't on them. It can't be easy to make a huge movie like this during a pandemic, but it definitely shows.The A. I. plot is quite good, and Hunt's as-yet-unknown backstory quite intriguing, but the whole story basically revolves around: \"I've got the key, now she's got the key, now he's got the key\" etc. So much pick-pocketing.Also, I really wish they hadn't ruined the motorcycle jump in the promos. If you've seen the promo, you've seen the scene. There are really only 3 or 4 action sequences, and nothing we haven't really seen before. I actually enjoyed the first desert shoot-out the best.And- oh!- the exposition! There's a scene near the beginning that reminded me of a Neil Breen(!) movie, where powerful people sit in a room and just spout buzz words like \"nuclear war,\" \"economic collapse,\" \"dogs and cats living together\" etc.THAT said, it's still an 8/10. Tom always gives it his best, the rest of the cast is good (especially all four female leads) and I thought the added humour with Hunt's character was a nice touch. I'd rather watch this ten times over than any blatant cyncial Disney cash-grab.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Good God. I feel ashamed for approaching this film with a modicum of doubt that Tom would still be able to deliver. Unbelievably, this epic actually manages to top the brilliant Fallout. Tom is literally going to die if he keeps doing these stunts. The motorbike sequence is utterly ludicrous. Intriguing plot with actual stakes and some familiar faces ably supported by brilliant new allies and villains. Sets up Part II perfectly with a sensational finale that homages Back to the Future 3, MI:1 and Speed. It is funny, action packed, polished and exhilarating. Harrison was great last week, but Tom is still the King. 9/10.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: I was lucky to be able to watch this 4 days before its official release in Czech Republic as a pre-premiere (didn't know such a thing existed) and it was the first time I've felt real excitement to go watch a film at the cinema in ages thanks to the recent genius combination of Fallout and Top Gun 2.I know what they were trying to do with this film. Bringing Kittridge back and a convoluted train finale all harked back to the 1st movie that sparked it all off. Explaining that convoluted storyline along the way harks back to the criticisms made about that same first film.The sky jump stunt was an attempt to beat the stunts from Tom Cruise in previous installments that have now become a beloved trademark of the franchise.But this film unfortunately overall is most reminiscent of the second installment which was Tom Cruise centric and lacked any real impossible mission requiring teamwork, real stakes and ingenious problem solving.In fact, it could have even been intentional that this film reminds the viewer of Mission Impossible 2. The photos in the film of past Ethan Hunt when searching for present Ethan Hunt show him with his longer hair as he looked in that second film.Ultimately, I expected the story to be way better than what we get in this instalment.There are 2 guys that keep appearing at each scene trying to catch Ethan which seems a very cheap simple story.And the very simple plot is explained in long scenes to make it seem way more complicated that it actually is (people complained there should be more explanation in the first film, but at least the plot in the first film actually required brain power), and I have to say that some of the acting is quite poor at times, not helped by some rather cheesy lines in the script, including the lines and accents in the opening Russian submarine sequence.There is also not that much action. 3 main action sequences for a close to 3 hour movie, which are the desert shoot out at the beginning, the Venice car chase, and the train crash at the end.I thought the alleyway fight scene, which some have praised, was really quite subpar and not very enthralling.The best action scene is the Venice car chase because it is genuinely funny (yes, because it is excellently laugh out loud funny, but not in any way tense); I never had the feeling that I was on the edge of my seat.The motorcycle sky jump scene was a major disappointment after the hype because if you didn't know Cruise actually did do that stunt, they used so much CGI that people would just assume it was computer generated. It actually reminded me of Pierce Brosnan's riding the tsunami in Die Another Day (sorry Tom! The stunt is still awesome!).The same for the train at the end. I know they actually made that train, and probably actually threw it off a bridge, but it doesn't look real. Though it is a long action finale and very fun to watch, for me the lack of realism takes away any tension. You are enjoying it for its visual value, but again not feeling any 'wow' factor or tension.At the end of Fallout, for example, you really felt Ethan Hunt was battered, bruised, worn out and still fighting to save humanity. There is none of that.The most tragic thing about this movie is that, unlike in the best of the previous films, we're back to the team being irrelevant in this one. Benji and Luther don't actually do very much.And poor Ilsa. Fallout ended with Ethan's ex-wife essentially giving him permission to move on and be with Ilsa.The relationship between Ilsa and Hunt had been built up over two excellent movies - Rogue Nation and Fallout - and in this film she says almost nothing, looks grumpy and sad all the time, and dies in an anticlimactic fight that is literally spelt out to the audience as a way to replace her with newcomer Grace.Grace, played by Hayley Atwell, is good. A likeable character and a capable actress, but I don't get the story unless Rebecca Ferguson said she wants out the franchise.The film is all about chasing \"the key.\" No twists. No high stakes. There is virtually no grittiness in this outing. It feels very light.Ultimately I was hoping to enjoy a quality film in the franchise. A movie like Oblivion, Edge of Tomorrow, Fallout, Top Gun 2 or American Made that you can show to anyone and say these are recent really high quality films starring this guy called Tom Cruise.This is not one of those films.It is more like The Mummy. It is better than Mission Impossible 2 but not better than any of the others in the franchise.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One confirms that Mission Impossible is the best franchise currently going and possibly ever made. A 2 hour 43 minute adrenaline rush that contains some of the best action sequences put to film, embarrasses the majority of the competition out there and sets the stage for a magnificent part 2 whilst still being a satisfying adventure in its own right.This is possibly the most open and obvious a Mission film has been with its deeper meaning for cinema and what aspect of Cruise's career is being dissected this time with a film that focuses on Ethan's relationship with women and basically outright declares AI to be a soulless monster and how the human element is always needed (perfect film to release during a writer's strike).Tom Cruise is perfect as Ethan Hunt and the strongest aspect this time round is when the film explores what made Ethan who he is and reminds you he genuinely cares about his team but that comes at a cost. Physically, the madman is still going strong with his stunts, driving a bike off a cliff in truly breathtaking fashion.Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg and Rebecca Ferguson remain the best IMF team and all play to their strengths here. The longer this series goes on the more authentic their growing friendship feels. Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis get more than expected and their buddy cop antics are a lot of fun.With Esai Morales' charismatic yet terrifying Gabriel and Pom Klementieff's terrific henchman of few words, this franchise finally has more good villains than bad. The return of Henry Czerny as Kittridge is glorious and he remains as gleefully despicable as his first appearance.The best new addition is easily Hayley Atwell. She plays a type of character never seen before in these films which makes her character and dynamic with Cruise fresh in comparison to everyone who's come before and their chemistry is magnetic. Instantaneous from the second they interact.Christopher McQuarrie's direction is phenomenal. The action sequences are suitably practical (this is how you spend $290 million), and the camera gets as close to the action as humanly possible, he remains one of the best in the business working at this scale. There's plenty of canted angles as a nice homage to De Palma's original and it helps give this one its own style in comparison to McQuarrie's previous entries.The pacing is really impressive with the film feeling like it's in a perpetual third act from its first airport heist (which is so much fun). Lorne Balfe does the music once again and yet again it's a highlight of the film, he knows how to elevate everything so well and really hammers home the emotional beats.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Ethan Hunt has left the mere secret agent status and has ascended to the all living perfect messiah.There is so much wrong with this movie, which seriously pains me because I seriously love this series. The mission impossible movies have steadily become more convoluted and more stupidly written. This film reaches the peak of absurdity, feeling more like an over the top fast and furious movie. All foolish action, cheap parlor tricks to pull the heart strings (empty relationships), horrible writing, poor plot development.I mean seriously what ever happened to show don't tell?! This is becoming rather ridiculous.*convoluted villain dialogue*\n",
            "\"So what you're telling me is you plan to establish a new world order if you get that key and if someone stops you that would be bad?!\"Has Ethan Hunt suddenly become this vanilla James Bond? With the Bond girl cycling through every few films? Lazy writing. Not natural feeling. Forced. BlighIt pains me to give this so low.The truth is, this movie is mindless entertaining action. Tom Cruise delivers on some awesome stunts (seldom compared to other MI films). It's not horrible. It's fun entertainment, but a scour on the (in my opinion) reputable authentic feeling mission impossible series.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: So you probably watched IM 6 and said, they can't make it any better can they? Or Top Gun 2, guess again, this is an adrenaline action movie with a good story, well written, action scenes that just blow you away, not a boring moment and you are on the edge of your seat all the time, this is how you make movies! Tom Cruise did it again, WOW!! It's an exhausting ride he takes you on, man I forgot to eat my popcorn and by the time i finally wanted some my wife had eaten all of it, but hey I was so immersed into the movie that time stood still and i forgot everything around me.Go and see it, this one gets my full recommendation, the only reason it's not a 10 is due to the fact it's not a completely new type of movie, however this one is done as a good action movie should be made, i don't see how they could have made it better, I really can't, go watch it and have a good time while you do it, it will put a big smile on your face that's for sure.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Am huge fan of MI franchise. The best part about all MI movies were how they plan and pull off an impossible mission. Thus I am quite disappointed on how this mission never seemed too difficult , let alone impossible.Action was okay. Car chase was funny, but not exciting. Jumping off the cliff seemed forced to me. Why would you keep driving uphill when you can take short cuts to reach the train. It wasn't even a fast train. The key kept being stolen from pockets too many times which makes you wonder how lazy the scripting was. Kill old gf to make new gf was also lazy writing.Unlike other MIs, Ethan had no single smart move or plan. It felt more like let's go and see what happens.Am not sure how MI fans ignored all these weaknesses and gave this film 8+ rating.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: This was a great movie. However, it lost a star from me for making the audience believe Ilsa is dead. They've spent two films building up Ilsa as being Ethan's equal, and hinted at an eventual romance. She's been able to fight off multiple men bare-handed yet she meets her demise by one guy when she has a sword? Then they brush past her death like it means nothing, only for her to be replaced by a new woman. I thought it was a huge disservice to the character.I know Rebecca Ferguson is very busy so she might have asked to leave, but I'm hoping this isn't the end for my favorite character in these films. She deserves a happy ending, or at least a better death than the one she received in this movie. It really took me out of the rest of the film. Hopefully, we'll see her again in Part Two.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Remember that classic MI scene where they broke in at CIA, and Cruise was hanging from the ceiling using wires? It's not a huge setpiece, but that scene is a nailbiting example of ingenious problem solving.In 'Dead Reckoning' there's none of that. Here it's keys changing hands every 10 minutes that is suppose to pass as suspense. And of course the only true selling point: the stunts performed by Tom Cruise.But I want and expect more than that.A large part of the film is devoted to people sitting or standing in a room, explaining what the plot is. Endless talking and explaining. We are told in several scenes the same information we just heard. Worst one is Benji, who is merely there to repeat things for someone in the cast, to make sure everyone in the audience knows what is going on. That is sloppy writing. One of the biggest no-no's as a screenwriter is resolving to \"so what you are saying is, that...\" info sharing. Benji does this all the time. And he is as incompetent as usual. And he is supposed to be a part of a small and unique team that is saving the world? Really?I hope MI:8 isn't just another Tom Cruise stunt reel where it looks like they make the story up as the go along, as long as all marks are checked in the end (running, face swapping, dealing with heights etc), and where character development takes a backseat. Bigger is not always better. And the action ALWAYS has to serve the story, not the other way around.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: After the first 30 minutes that promised an intellectual action thriller, the film starts its nosedive into mediocrity by introducing a thief who constantly indulges in disloyalty, for petty gains, towards the IMF and Hunt, but is held in high regards by Hunt. For the life of me, I couldn't understand why. The film also doesn't bother with it.Neither is it concerned with the so called action set pieces. _Fallout_ had plethora of those, one after the other, tied together by a cogent story line. For all its hype, it has 2-3 in a run time of close to 160 minutes, which tested my patience.Reading it's critics' reviews post viewing make me feel as if they have been written by the Entity, the AI behemoth at the center of this. The perceived entertainment value implied by them is not even remotely connected with the reality.It is no wonder that it is faltering at the US box office. It is no Top Gun- Maverick. Crowds are going to turn up, especially outside the US, because of Cruise's star power. But I don't believe this will please most of them.Disappointing.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: An absolute masterclass in producing an enjoyable action movie. Cinematography was great, the story was paced extremely well, and the casting of ALL roles was absolutely perfect.Cruise, Pegg and Rhames were awesome as always, Whigham and Davis were great additions, but the power quartet of Ferguson, Atwell, Klementieff and Kirby, really went above and beyond in making this movie perfect. Not to mention the chilling confidence of Morales as Gabriel, who practically oozes tangible danger.From the pre-opening credits scene to the final act, if you're like me, you will be on the edge of your seat - especially during any fight scene that involves Ferguson or Klementieff - and whilst there are moments that the tempo slows down to advance the story, it is always completely captivating.The single, solitary, disappointment comes as the credits roll, and you remember you're going to have to wait until next year to see how it ends.\n",

Just let Tom Cruise run, do some crazy stunts and play the iconic theme music. But no they gotta drag on for three hours with a meaningless storyline just for it to be one part of an incomplete movie. Like whatever happened to movie editing? There's no reason for this movie to be this long and a lot of the content is completely unnecessary to move the plot forward. I don't expect MI movies to have watertight logic but then atleast the writers shouldn't twist themselves into knots thinking they're making a deeper movie than they are, the sooner these movie trends with AI, quantum space tunneling, multiverse nonsense end the better it is for good storylines.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: This latest Mission: Impossible movie is a slam dunk that needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible. Tom Cruise certainly knows how to make a movie. In another universe Cruse could have been Iron Man and I always felt that his aggression with the Mission: Impossible franchise was his way of making up for that. That's probably why the dialog in this movie felt like Ethan Hawk was captain America or something and they are going up against a Bonafede supervillain in the form of an A. I system. As far as I'm concern the best villain of the franchise snice the late and great Phillip Seymour Huffman.The Avengers Assemble as franchise regulars Simon Pegg as Dunn and Ving Rhimes, who I say with glee, started this franchise with Cruse as Luther, make their return as IMF agents. Rebecca Ferguson reprises her role from the last movie and Haley Atwell is in the movie as well, but none of this makes me as happy as Ving still being in the franchise.The action sequences are so good in this picture. It was worth having to stay in me seat for almost three hours just so they can add a little more action in-between the Hero's journey dialogue.And this is just part one!? Part two has some big shoes to fill!\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: I love Tom Cruise movies, but this one feels pretty contrived. Beyond the plot, Grace was the biggest detriment to the movie. The character started out amusing but her shtick became insufferable and Ethan's infatuation idiotic. How they handled Ilsa feels both rushed and cheap, with no emotional weight felt. The biggest stunt was spoiled beforehand which I suppose did its job in getting me in the seat, but totally ruins the moment in film. The final act also lacked any tension and was honestly a little boring - there wasn't any real cleverness.Still, it was humorous throughout, had a good amount of charm and the production value is evident. That's enough for me to be above average but it's unlikely I'll watch the followup in theater.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: As a hardout Mission fan. I can confirm 5 years was definitely worth the wait. The film is extremally charming and filled with exciting humor, action and story-telling. Tom and Hayley really bring the film so much joy and create wonderful chemistry. The chase scene in Rome puts you on the edge of your seat and nothing prepares you for the daring things Tom and Hayley pull off in the train sequence.. Tom really understands the action genre and did not disappoint with this film. There is a perfect blend between foundation building for the story and the action sequences.

I think it's the weakest out of the last four instalments.I can't put my finger on one exact thing but it just felt a little underdone compared to the last few M:I and was expecting big things the whole movie. It was a combination of things like the acting felt a little weak I guess, the script was just fine, the action was decent but not great compared to other M:I and to the likes of John Wick that I'm now used to. The plot with the A. I is nothing new but it's always still interesting and especially at a time in the real world where the advancements seem to be heating up but the whole pickpocketing the key for 2 hours also got boring so fast. Too many cliches started piling up. The hand to hand combat was some of the weakest stuff I've seen it a while especially the Venice bridge scene, it looked awful, like I could see the choreography. The best scene for me was the desert storm at the start which really had my attention but everything after that seemed just average.I don't know if everyone else is now completely over their only trick being having someone go as someone else with these masks. It's so boring to me now and at a stage I'm kinda rolling my eyes. I really hope the machine blowing a fuse means we have seen the last of them.Tom Cruise is awesome with the stunts he does and will always have respect for the things him doing them but I really wish they didn't show the motorbike cliff jump scene in the trailer. What you see in the trailer is literally the whole stunt, don't get me wrong it's truly impressive but they showed the whole thing and just completely killed it for me.I'm slightly bummed with this one and just coming off seeing Indian Jones and having a lot more fun watching that. I don't care about runtimes but you have to have me sucked in and the whole time, I felt the time...People will love this movie but M:I may have fizzled out with me a bit after this one.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Greetings again from the darkness. The challenge in continuing the \"Mission: Impossible\" franchise is that fans expect each entry to be \"bigger\" and more awe-inspiring than the last. With the seventh film in the series, and the third straight he has directed, writer-director Christopher McQuarrie and superstar actor and daredevil Tom Cruise have managed to accomplish what seemed unlikely ... they have delivered Ethan Hunt's biggest and grandest mission yet. Prepare to be awed by the action.You should know that this is \"Part One\" and it runs 163 minutes, a full hour longer than most movies, and exponentially more expensive to produce. All this during an age when ultra-high-budget blockbusters are being rumored to be fading from public interest. Of course, we are only one year removed from Tom Cruise's TOP GUN: MAVERICK being credited with 'saving cinema', so stay on alert for a 'sky is falling' panic. McQuarrie co-wrote the script with Erik Jendresen (\"Band of Brothers\"), and they remain faithful to the characters and storylines established by the TV series creator, Bruce Geller.There may never have been an actor more suited to a recurring role than Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt (Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones might be the closest). The story itself is fairly straightforward, even if the item being chased often feels like a MacGuffin. Your questioning of how a 'simple' spy-thriller can be effective is understandable, yet it's fascinating to watch as Ethan Hunt's mission in life as an agent is evaluated, as is the cost he's paid as a man. Providing a contemporary theme, the obscure object of desire is an all-powerful key (actually two parts of a key) based on controlling an all-encompassing Artificial Intelligence (AI).In a twist on a familiar theme (and a classic comedy film), we have Airports, Trains, and EVs, the latter being a tiny Fiat with handcuffs. Still, the car chase is everything we might hope, while the high-tech facial search in the airport sequence delivers the thrills for techie viewers, and the train sparring occurs inside as well as on top. And lest you be worried, there are enough Cruise sprint scenes here to put CHARIOTS OF FIRE to shame.Familiar faces include Ethan Hunt's team of Luther (Ving Rhames, who along with Cruise, has appeared in all 7 MI films), Benji (Simon Pegg), and Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson). It's nice to again see (and hear) Henry Czerny as Kittridge, Vanessa Kirby as arms dealer The White Widow, and Esai Morales - as Gabriel, the required villain in search of the same key as our good guys. New faces include Haylee Atwell as master pickpocket Grace, whose soul may or may not be beyond salvation; Cary Elwes as agency director Denlinger; Shea Whigham and Greg Tarzan Davis as officers after rogue Hunt; and Pom Klementieff as a hired assassin.The stunt work here is outstanding, and of course, Tom Cruise is renowned for personally handling many of the most breathtaking acts - the most memorable one here being his riding of a motorcycle off a cliff. This stunt has a 'making of' video that's been available for a while. As movie goers, we've never seen anything like it. This part one was originally scheduled for release in 2021 (thanks a lot, COVID), and now Part Two is set for 2024. It's been 27 years since the MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE (1996) with Jon Voight ... Cruise was 34 in that one. This particular mission is the biggest yet, and it would certainly be impossible for the rest of us. It's a mission that will be closed out in Part Two, and simultaneously bring an end to Cruise's remarkable run as Ethan Hunt.Opening July 12, 2023.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: This movie started out promising but by the end, it just felt like being robbed of two and a half hours. I am a big fan of the MI movies (including MI2, which people seem to hate) and I could appreciate this movie for the few scenes that it did right, but it treats the audience like idiots in its bland, repetitive storyline (how many times do we need to hear the words \"the key\" and \"the entity\"? It was as if the writers of this movie just gave up on their jobs when they wrote this. Easily the weakest MI movie ever filmed. It had me staring at my watch every 20 minutes. As others have mentioned, the character development in this movie is also truly awful. I have barely any interest in seeing Part Two of Dead Reckoning at this point. The high scores this movie is getting absolutely baffle me. This movie by no means deserves a score higher than a 6 or a 6.5.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: Basically, this movie is big, loud, and stupid.Definitely TOO loud, in fact. The music attempts to turn even the most minor scene into some sort of heart-pounding climax.There are endless ridiculous fights in which Tom Cruise is predictably unstoppable, no matter how many opponents he's up against. Slim girls get to beat up multiple men. (Emily Blunt was right when, commenting on a fight in \"Sicario\" in which, refreshingly, she loses to a bigger guy, she noted that Hollywood fight scenes in which 110-pound women whip larger males are \"so cheesy.\")The dull, tepid, way-too-pretty villain is, implausibly, a formidable fighter but sure doesn't look like one. An action movie is only as good as its villain is evil; this guy looks like a French fashion mogul.He and Cruise fight on top of -- wait for it -- a moving train! Haven't we seen that ridiculous sort of thing a hundred times before?The tediously overcomplicated plot makes it hard to keep track of who's on which side, nor do we care. Apparently, as is usual these days, we're supposed to root against the U. S. government.In all scenes involving conversations, virtually EVERY line is merely plot exposition in which characters tell us, in stilted dialogue, what's going on, what's supposed to happen, and how we're supposed to feel.The much-touted parachute jump is actually disappointing. It's over quite fast, and its main source of interest is that, if you've seen the promotional video, you know that Cruise himself actually made that jump.The only truly enjoyable sequence -- the cleverly worked-out rescue attempts on the falling train -- comes at the end, after nearly two and a half hours of empty cartoonish nonsense...Including, of course, an overlong cartoonish car chase, obligatory in dumb summer movies.\n",
            "Skipping non-numeric rating: The latest Mission: Impossible film is a part one of two story but finishes in a satisfying way rather than annoying and you won't feel hard done by.It's another great big screen action film that we've come to expect. It feels huge the whole time however I must say I while the set pieces were stellar, the hand to hand combat scenes were not great and a big step down from the last film (Fallout).Thebeginning is slow with a lot of expository being dumped (more than you'd usually see) but once it gets going it is pretty nonstop.This is a good chapter and Haley Atwell shines but it is nowhere near my favorite of the series.7/10Mi rankingsMi6 Fallout\n",

            "Skipping non-numeric rating: 'Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part I (M:I7) is another strong entry in the action/spy series, with Ethan (Cruise) looking slightly older, but not less determined to save the world. I believe the sequel to this film will be his last outing - but we'll see. This time, there's some Skynet-like sentient-AI that's manipulating nefarious types to take over the world, so the IMF team are out to get the two halves of key that can stop it.Isla (Ferguson), Benji (Pegg) and Luther (Rhames) are back, as well as CIA boss Kittridge (Czerny), with Grace (Atwell), a thief, being the newcomer. The bad guys that keep thwarting them are Gabriel (Morales) from Ethan's past, and Paris (Klementieff). The consistency of having McQuarrie as director of the two previous films helps, with everything feeling assured and this working as a really solid follow-up to 'Fallout'.There's some funny moments, some sincere ones, and some of Ethan running, as contractually-obliged. The whole final scene on the train is excellent, with so many things happening, but there's plenty of good set-pieces throughout, including a good car chase. However, the piece-de-resistance is the motorbike off the cliff into a BASE jump is something else. The fact Cruise did it for real, multiple times, is crazy and inspiring.\n"
